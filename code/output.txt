[   'OF all the lords in Scotland fair,   And ladies that been so bright of '
    'blee, There is a noble lady among them all, And report of her you shall '
    'hear by me. ',
    "For of her beauty she is bright, And of her colour very fair; She's "
    "daughter to Lord Arundel, And of her colour very fair; She's daughter to "
    'Lord Arundel, Approvd his parand and his heir. ',
    "`I'le see this bride,' Lord Phenix said, `That lady of so bright a blee, "
    "And if I like her countenance well, The heir of all my lands she'st be.' ",
    'But when he came the lady before, Before this comely maid came he, `O God '
    "thee save, thou lady sweet, My heir and parand thou shalt be.' ",
    "`Leave off your suit,' the lady said, `As you are a lord of high degree; "
    'And I have a lord in mine own country. ',
    '`For I have a lover true of mine own, A serving-man of low degree, One '
    "Tommy Pots it is his name, My first love and last that ever shall be.' ",
    '`If that Tom Pots is his name, I do ken him right verily; I am able to '
    "spend fourty pounds a week, Where he is not able to spend pounds three.' ",
    "`God give you good of your gold,' she said, `And ever God give you good "
    'of your fee; Tom Pots was the first love that ever I had, And I do mean '
    "him the last to be.' ",
    'With that Lord Phenix soon was movd; Towards the lady did he threat; He '
    "told her father, and so it was provd, How his daughter's mind was set. ",
    '`O daughter dear, thou art my own, The heir of all my lands to be; Thou '
    "shalt be bride to the Lord Phenix, If that thou mean to be heir to me.' ",
    '`O father dear, I am your own, And at your command I needs must be; But '
    'bind my body to whom you please, My heart, Tom Pots, shall go with '
    "thee.' ",
    'Alas! the lady her fondness must leave, And all her foolish wooing lay '
    'aside; The time is come, her friends have appointed, That she must be '
    'Lord Phenix bride.   ',
    'With that the lady began to weep; She knew not well then what to say, How '
    'she might Lord Phenix deny, And escape from marriage quite away. ',
    'See calld unto her little foot-page, Saying, I can trust none but thee; '
    'Go carry Tom Pots this letter fair, And bid him on Guilford Green meet '
    'me. ',
    'For I must marry against my mind, Or in faith well proved it shall be; '
    'And tell to him I am loving and kind, And wishes him this wedding to '
    'see. ',
    'But see that thou note his countenance well, And his colour, and shew it '
    'to me; And go thy way and hie thee again, And forty shillings I will give '
    'thee. ',
    'For if he smile now with his lips, His stomach will give him to laugh at '
    'the heart; Then may I seek another true-love, For of Tom Pots small is my '
    'part. ',
    'But if he blush now in his face, Then in his heart he will sorry be; Then '
    'to his vow he hath some grace, And false to him I will never be. ',
    'Away this lacky-boy he ran, And a full speed forsooth went he,',
    'Away this lacky-boy he ran, And a full speed forsooth went he, Till he '
    'came to Strawberry Castle, And there Tom Pots came he to see. ',
    'He gave him the letter in his hand; Before that he began to read, He told '
    "him plainly by word of mouth, His love was forc'd to be Lord Phenix "
    'bride. ',
    'When he lookd on the letter fair, The salt tears blemished his eye; Says, '
    'I cannot read this letter fair, Nor never a word to see or spy. ',
    'My little boy, be to me true, Here is five marks I will give thee; And '
    'all these words I must peruse, And tell my lady this from me. ',
    "By faith and troth she is my own, By some part of promise, so it's to be "
    'found; Lord Phenix shall not have her night nor day, Except he can win '
    'her with his own hand. ',
    'On Guilford Green I will her meet; Say that I wish her for me to pray; '
    "For there I'le lose my life so sweet,   Or else the wedding I mean to "
    'stay. ',
    'Away this lackey-boy he ran, Even as fast as he could hie; The lady she '
    'met him two miles of the way; Says, Why hast thou staid so long, my boy? ',
    "My little boy, thou art but young, It gives me at heart thou'l mock and "
    "scorn; I'le not believe thee by word of mouth, Unless on this book thou "
    'wilt be sworn. ',
    "`Now by this book,' the boy did say, `And Jesus Christ be as true to me, "
    'Tom Pots could not read the letter fair, Nor never a word to spy or see. ',
    '`He says, by faith and troth you are his own, By some part of promise, so '
    "it's to be found; Loirdr Phenix shall not have you night nor day, Except "
    'he win you with his own hand. ',
    '`On Guilford Green he will you meet; He wishes you for him to pray; For '
    "there he'l lose his life so sweet, Or else the wedding he means to "
    "stay.' ",
    '`If this be true, my little boy, These tidings which thou tellest to me, '
    'Forty shillings I did thee promise, Here is ten pounds I will give thee. ',
    "`My maidens all,' the lady said, `That ever wish me well to prove, Now "
    'let us all kneel down and pray That Tommy Pots may win his love. ',
    '`If it be his fortune the better to win, As I pray to Christ in Trinity, '
    "I'le make him the flower of all his kin, For the young Lord Arundel he "
    "shall be.' ",
    "Let's leave talking of this lady fair, In prayers full good where she may "
    'be; Now let us talk of Tommy Pots; To his lord and master for aid went '
    'he. ',
    'But when he came Lord Jockey before, He kneeled lowly on his knee: `What '
    'news, what news, thou Tommy Pots, Thou art so full of courtesie? ',
    '`What tydings, what tydings, thou Tommy Pots, Thou art so full of '
    'courtesie? Thou hast slain some of thy fellows fair, Or wrought to me '
    "some villany.' ",
    '`I have slain none of my fellows fair, Nor wrought to you no villany, But '
    'I have a love in Scotland fair,   And I fear I shall lose her with '
    'poverty. ',
    "`If you'l not believe me by word of mouth, But read this letter, and you "
    'shall see, Here by all these suspitious words That she her own self hath '
    "sent to me.' ",
    'But when he had read the letter fair, Of all the suspitious words in it '
    "might be, `O Tommy Pots, take thou no care, Thou'st never lose her with "
    'poverty. ',
    "`For thou'st have forty pounds a week, In gold and silver thou shalt row, "
    'And Harvy Town I will give thee As long as thou intendst to wooe. ',
    "`Thou'st have forty of thy fellows fair, And forty horses to go with "
    "thee, Forty of the best spears I have, And I my self in thy company.' ",
    "`I thank you, master,' said Tommy Pots, `That proffer is too good for me; "
    'But, if Jesus Christ stand on my side, My own hands shall set her free. ',
    "`God be with you, master,' said Tommy Pots, `Now Jesus Christ you save "
    "and see; If ever I come alive again, Staid the wedding it shall be.' ",
    '`O God be your speed, thou Tommy Pots, Thou art well proved for a man; '
    'See never a drop of blood thou spil, Nor yonder gentleman confound. ',
    '`See that some truce with him you take, And appoint a place of liberty; '
    "Let him provide him as well as he can, As well provided thou shalt be.' ",
    'But when he came to Guilford Green, And there had walkt a little aside, '
    'There was he ware of Lord Phenix come, And Lady Rosamond his bride. ',
    'Away by the bride then Tommy Pots went, But never a word to her did say, '
    'Till he the Lord Phenix came before; He gave him the right time of the '
    'day. ',
    '`O welcome, welcome, thou Tommy Pots, Thou serving-man of low degree; How '
    "doth thy lord and master at home, And all the ladies in that countrey?' ",
    '`My lord and master is in good health, I trust since that I did him see; '
    'Will you walk with me to an out-side,   Two or three words to talk with '
    'me? ',
    "`You are a noble man,' said Tom, `And born a lord in Scotland free; You "
    "may have ladies enough at home, And never take my love from me.' ",
    '`Away, away, thou Tommy Pots; Thou serving-man, stand thou aside; It is '
    "not a serving-man this day That can hinder me of my bride.' ",
    "`If I be a serving-man,' said Tom, `And you a lord of high degree, A "
    "spear or two with you I'le run, Before I'le lose her cowardly. ",
    '`Appoint a place, I will thee meet, Appoint a place of liberty; For there '
    "I'le lose my life so sweet, Or else my lady I'le set free.' ",
    "`On Guilford Green I will thee meet; No man nor boy shall come with me:' "
    "`As I am a man,' said Tommy Pots, `I'le have as few in my company.' ",
    'And thus staid the marriage was, The bride unmarried went home again; '
    'Then to her maids fast did she laugh, And in her heart she was full '
    'fain. ',
    "`My maidens all,' the lady said, `That ever wait on me this day, Now let "
    'us all kneel down, And for Tommy Pots let us all pray. ',
    '`If it be his fortune the better to win, As I trust to God in Trinity, '
    "I'le make him the flower of all his kin, For the young Lord Arundel he "
    "shall be.' ",
    'When Tom Pots came home again, To try for his love he had but a week; For '
    'sorrow, God wot, he need not care, For four days that he fel sick. ',
    'With that his master to him came, Says, Pray thee, Tom Pots, tell me if '
    'tho doubt Whether thou hast gotten thy gay lady, Or thou must go thy love '
    'without. ',
    "`O master, yet it is unknown; Within these two days well try'd it must "
    'be; He is a lord, I am but a serving-man, I fear I shall lose her with '
    "poverty.' ",
    '`I prethee, Tom Pots, get thee on thy feet; My former promises kept shall '
    "be; As I am a lord in Scotland fair,   Thou'st never lose her with "
    'poverty. ',
    "`For thou'st have the half of my lands a year, And that will raise thee "
    'many a pound; Before thou shalt out-braved be, Thou shalt drop angels '
    "with him on the ground.' ",
    "`I thank you, master,' said Tommy Pots, `Yet there is one thing of you I "
    "would fain; If that I lose my lady sweet, How I'st restore your goods "
    "again?' ",
    '`If that thou win the lady sweet, Thou mayst well forth, thou shalt pay '
    'me; If thou loosest thy lady, thou losest enough; Thou shalt not pay me '
    "one penny.' ",
    '`You have thirty horses in one close, You keep them all both frank and '
    "free; Amongst them all there's an old white horse This day would set my "
    'lady free. ',
    '`That is an old horse with a cut tail, Full sixteen years of age is he; '
    "If thou wilt lend me that old horse, Then could I win her easily.' ",
    "`That's a foolish opinion,' his master said, `And a foolish opinion thou "
    "tak'st to thee; Thou'st have a better then ever he was, Though forty "
    "pounds more it cost me.' ",
    '`O your choice horses are wild and tough, And little they can skill of '
    "their train; If I be out of my saddle cast, They are so wild they'l ner "
    "be tain.' ",
    "`Thou'st have that horse,' his master said, `If that one thing thou wilt "

    "`You have broken your vow,' said Tommy Pots, `The vow which you did make "
    'to me; You said you would bring neither man nor boy, And now has brought '
    "more than two or three.' ",

    "either of us be slain this day, The other shall forgiven be.' ",
    "`I'le make that vow with all my heart, My men shall bear witness with me; "
    'And if thou slay me here this day, In Scotland worse belovd thou never '
    "shalt be.' ",
    'They turnd their horses thrice about, To run the race so eagerly; Lord '

    'wife, I pray thee, Lord Phenix, ride not away, For with thee I would end '
    "my life.' ",
    'Tom Pots was but a serving-man, But yet he was a doctor good; He bound '
    'his handkerchief on his wound, And with some kind of words he stancht his '
    'blood. ',
    'He leapt into his saddle again, The blood in his body began to warm; He '
    'mist Lord Phenix body fair, iAndr ran him through the brawn of the arm. ',
    'He bord him out of his saddle fair, Down to the ground most sorrowfully; '
    'Says, Prethee, Lord Phenix, rise up and fight,   Or yield my lady unto '
    'me. ',
    '`Now for to fight I cannot tell, And for to fight I am not sure; Thou '
    "hast run me throw the brawn o th' arm, That with a spear I may not "
    'endure. ',
    "`Thou'st have the lady with all my heart; It was never likely better to "
    'prove With me, or any nobleman else, That would hinder a poor man of his '
    "love.' ",
    "`Seeing you say so much,' said Tommy Pots, `I will not seem your butcher "
    'to be; But I will come and stanch your blood, If any thing you will give '
    "me.' ",
    'As he did stanch Lord Phenix blood, Lord, in his heart he did rejoyce! '
    "`I'le not take the lady from you thus, But of her you'st have another "
    'choice. ',
    '`Here is a lane of two miles long; At either end we set will be; The lady '
    "shall stand us among, Her own choice shall set her free.' ",
    "`If thou'l do so,' Lord Phenix said, `To lose her by her own choice it's "
    'honesty; Chuse whether I get her or go her without, Forty pounds I will '
    "give thee.' ",
    'But when they in that lane was set, The wit of a woman for to prove, `By '
    "the faith of my body,' the lady said, `Then Tom Pots must needs have his "
    "love.' ",
    'Towards Tom Pots the lady did hie, To get on behind him hastily; `Nay '
    "stay, nay stay,' Lord Phenix said, `Better proved it shall be. ",
    '`Stay you with your maidens here-- In number fair they are but three-- '
    'Tom Pots and I will go behind yonder wall, That one of us two be proved '
    "to dye.' ",
    'But when they came behind the wall, The one came not the other nigh; For '
    'the Lord Phenix had made a vow, That with Tom Pots he would never fight. ',
    "`O give me this choice,' Lord Phenix said, `To prove whether true or "
    'false she be, And I will go to the lady fair, And tell her Tom Pots slain '

[   'IN summer time, when leaves grow green,  And flowers are fresh and gay, '

    'eat nor drink Till the frier he did see. ',
    'Robin Hood put on his harness good, And on his head a cap of steel, Broad '

[   'WHEN Robin Hood was about twenty years old, With a hey down down and a '
    'down He happend to meet Little John, A jolly brisk blade, right fit for '
    'the trade, For he was a lusty young man.   ',
    'Tho he was calld Little, his limbs they were large, And his stature was '
    "seven foot high; Where-ever he came, they quak'd at his name, For soon he "
    'would make them to fly. ',
    "How they came acquainted, I'll tell you in brief, If you will but listen "
    'a while; For this very jest, amongst all the rest, I think it may cause '
    'you to smile. ',
    'Bold Robin Hood said to his jolly bowmen, Pray tarry you here in this '
    'grove; And see that you all observe well my call, While thorough the '
    'forest I rove. ',
    'We have had no sport for these fourteen long days, Therefore now abroad '
    'will I go; Now should I be beat, and cannot retreat, My horn I will '
    'presently blow. ',
    'Then did he shake hands with his merry men all, And bid them at present '
    "good b'w'ye; Then, as near a brook his journey he took, A stranger he "
    'chancd to espy. ',
    'They happend to meet on a long narrow bridge, And neither of them would '
    "give way; Quoth bold Robin Hood, and sturdily stood, I'll show you right "
    'Nottingham play. ',
    'With that from his quiver an arrow he drew, A broad arrow with a '
    "goose-wing: The stranger reply'd, I'll liquor thy hide, If thou offerst "
    'to touch the string. ',
    'Quoth bold Robin Hood, Thou dost prate like an ass, For were I to bend '
    'but my bow, I could send a dart quite thro thy proud heart, Before thou '
    'couldst strike me one blow. ',
    "`Thou talkst like a coward,' the stranger reply'd; `Well armed with a "
    'long bow you stand, To shoot at my breast, while I, I protest, Have '
    "nought but a staff in my hand.' ",
    "`The name of a coward,' quoth Robin, `I scorn, Wherefore my long bow I'll "
    'lay by; And now, for thy sake, a staff will I take, The truth of thy '
    "manhood to try.' ",
    'Then Robin Hood stept to a thicket of trees, And chose him a staff of '
    'ground-oak; Now this being done, away he did run To the stranger, and '
    'merrily spoke: ',
    'Lo! see my staff, it is lusty and tough, Now here on the bridge we will '
    "play; Whoever falls in, the other shall win The battel, and so we'll "
    'away.   ',
    "`With all my whole heart,' the stranger reply'd; `I scorn in the least to "
    "give out;' This said, they fell to't without more dispute, And their "
    'staffs they did flourish about. ',
    'And first Robin he gave the stranger a bang, So hard that it made his '
    "bones ring: The stranger he said, This must be repaid, I'll give you as "
    'good as you bring. ',
    "So long as I'm able to handle my staff, To die in your debt, friend, I "
    'scorn: Then to it each goes, and followd their blows, As if they had been '
    'threshing of corn. ',
    'The stranger gave Robin a crack on the crown, Which caused the blood to '
    "appear; Then Robin, enrag'd, more fiercely engag'd, And followd his blows "
    'more severe. ',
    'So thick and so fast dic he lay it on him, With a passionate fury and '
    'ire, At every stroke, he made him to smoke, As if he had been all on '
    'fire. ',
    'O then into fury the stranger he grew, And gave him a damnable look, And '
    'with it a blow that laid him full low, And tumbld him into the brook. ',
    "`I prithee, good fellow, O where art thou now?' The stranger, in "
    "laughter, he cry'd; Quoth bold Robin Hood, Good faith, in the flood, And "
    'floating along with the tide. ',
    "I needs must acknowledge thou art a brave soul; With thee I'll no longer "
    'contend; For needs must I say, thou hast got the day, Our battel shall be '
    'at an end. ',
    'Then unto the bank he did presently wade, And pulld himself out by a '
    'thorn; Which done, at the last, he blowd a loud blast Straitway on his '
    'fine bugle-horn. ',
    'The eccho of which through the vallies did fly, At which his stout bowmen '
    'appeard, All cloathed in green, most gay to be seen; So up to their '
    'master they steerd. ',
    "`O what's the matter?' quoth William Stutely; `Good master, you are wet "
    "to the skin:' `No matter,' quoth he; 'The lad which you see, In fighting, "
    "hath tumbld me in.' ",
    "`He shall not go scot-free,' the others reply'd; So strait they were "
    'seizing him there, To duck him likewise; but Robin Hood cries, He is a '
    'stout fellow, forbear.   ',
    "There's no one shall wrong thee, friend, be not afraid; These bowmen upon "
    "me do wait; There's threescore and nine; if thou wilt be mine, Thou shalt "
    'have my livery strait. ',
    'And other accoutrements fit for a man; Speak up, jolly blade, never fear; '
    "I'll teach you also the use of the bow, To shoot at the fat fallow-deer. ",
    "`O here is my hand,' the stranger reply'd, `I'll serve you with all my "
    'whole heart; My name is John Little, a man of good mettle; Nere doubt me, '
    "for I'll play my part.' ",
    "His name shall be alterd,' quoth William Stutely, `And I will his "
    'godfather be; Prepare then a feast, and none of the least, For we will be '
    "merry,' quoth he. ",
    'They presently fetchd in a brace of fat does, With humming strong liquor '
    'likewise; They lovd what was good; so, in the greenwood, This pretty '
    'sweet babe they baptize. ',
    'He was, I must tell you, but seven foot high, And, may be, an ell in the '
    'waste; A pretty sweet lad; much feasting they had; Bold Robin the '
    "christning grac'd. ",
    'With all his bowmen, which stood in a ring, And were of the Notti<n>gham '
    'breed; Brave Stutely comes then, with seven yeomen, And did in this '
    'manner proceed. ',
    "`This infant was called John Little,' quoth he, `Which name shall be "
    "changed anon; The words we'll transpose, so where-ever he goes, His name "
    "shall be calld Little John.' ",
    'They all with a shout made the elements ring, So soon as the office was '
    'ore; To feasting they went, with true merriment, And tippld strong liquor '
    'gillore. ',
    'Then Robin he took the pretty sweet babe, And cloathd him from top to the '
    'toe In garments of green, most gay to be seen, And gave him a curious '
    'long bow. ',
    '`Thou shalt be an archer as well as the best, And range in the greenwood '
    "with us; Where we'll not want gold nor silver, behold, While bishops have "
    'ought in their purse. ',
    '`We live here like squires, or lords of renown, Without ere a foot of '
    'free land; We feast on good cheer, with wine, ale and beer, And evry '
    "thing at our command.'   ",
    'Then musick and dancing did finish the day; At length, when the sun waxed '
    'low, Then all the whole train the grove did refrain, And unto their caves '
    'they did go. ',
    'And so ever after, as long as he livd, Altho he was proper and tall, Yet '
    'nevertheless, the truth to express, Still Little John they did him call.']

    "`What is that news?' the Tinker said; `Tell mee without delay; I am a "
    "tinker by my trade, And do live at Banbura.' ",
    "`As for the news,' quoth Robin Hood, `It is but as I hear; Two tinkers "
    "they were set ith' stocks, For drinking ale and bear.' ",
    "`If that be all,' the Tinker said, `As I may say to you, Your news it is "
    'not worth a fart, Since that they all bee true. ',
    "`For drinking of good ale and bear, You wil not lose your part:' `No, by "

    "Being thou goest from town to town, Some news thou need not fear.'   ",
    "`All the news,' the Tinker said, `I hear, it is for good; It is to seek a "
    'bold outlaw, Which they call Robin Hood. ',
    '`I have a warrant from the king, To take him where I can; If you can tell '
    'me where hee is, I will make you a man. ',
    '`The king will give a hundred pound That hee could but him see; And if '

    "go to Nottingham, Wee shall find him I know.' ",
    'The Tinker had a crab-tree staff, Which was both good and strong; Robin '
    'hee had a good strong blade, So they went both along. ',
    'And when they came to Nottingham, There they both tooke one inn; And they '
    'calld for ale and wine, To drink it was no sin. ',
    'But ale and wine they drank so fast That the Tinker hee forgot What thing '
    'he was about to do; It fell so to his lot ',
    'That while the Tinker fell asleep, Hee made then haste away, And left the '
    'Tinker in the lurch, For the great shot to pay. ',
    'But when the Tinker wakened, And saw that he was gone, He calld then even '
    'for his host, And thus hee made his moan. ',

    'take a bold outlaw, Some call him Robin Hood.   ',
    "`But now my warrant and mony's gone, Nothing I have to pay; And he that "
    "promised to be my friend, He is gone and fled away.' ",

    "when that first hee met with you, He ment you little good.' ",
    "`Had I known it had been hee, When that I had him here, Th' one of us "
    "should have tri'd our strength Which should have paid full dear. ",

    'and seek him out, What ever do me betide. ',
    "`But one thing I would gladly know, What here I have to pay;' `Ten "
    "shillings just,' then said the host; `I'le pay without delay. ",
    '`Or elce take here my working-bag, And my good hammer too; And if that I '
    "light but on the knave, I will then soon pay you.' ",
    "`The onely way,' then said the host, `And not to stand in fear, Is to "
    "seek him among the parks, Killing of the kings deer.' ",
    'The Tinker hee then went with speed, And made then no delay, Till he had '
    'found then Robin Hood, That they might have a fray. ',
    "At last hee spy'd him in a park, Hunting then of the deer; `What knave is "
    "that,' quoth Robin Hood, R'Trhat doth come mee so near?' ",
    "`No knave, no knave,' the Tinker said, `And that you soon shall know; "
    "Whether of us hath done most wrong, My crab-tree staff shall show.' ",
    'Then Robin drew his gallant blade, Made then of trusty steel; But the '
    'Tinker laid on him so fast That he made Robin reel. ',
    'Then Robins anger did arise; He fought full manfully, Vntil hee made the '
    'Tinker Almost then fit to fly.   ',
    "With that they had a bout again, They ply'd their weapons fast; The "
    'Tinker threshed his bones so sore He made him yeeld at last. ',
    "`A boon, a boon,' Robin hee cryes, `If thou wilt grant it mee;' `Before I "
    "do it,' the Tinker said, `I'le hang thee on this tree.' ",
    'But the Tinker looking him about, Robin his horn did blow; Then came unto '
    'him Little John, And William Scadlock too. ',
    "`What is the matter,' quoth Little John, `You sit in th' highway side?' "
    "`Here is a Tinker that stands by, That hath paid well my hide.' ",
    "`That Tinker,' then said Little John, `Fain that blade I would see, And I "
    "would try what I could do, If hee'l do as much for mee.' ",
    'But Robin hee then wishd them both They should the quarrel cease, `That '
    'henceforth wee may bee as one, And ever live in peace. ',
    "`And for the jovial Tinker's part, A hundred pound I'le give, In th' year "
    'to maintain him on, As long as he doth live. ',
    '`In manhood hee is a mettle man, And a mettle man by trade; I never '
    'thought that any man Should have made me so fraid. ',
    '`And if hee will bee one of us, Wee will take all one fare, And '
    "whatsoever wee do get, He shall have his full share.' ",

    "I'll give thee this ring as a token of love, For bravely thou'st acted "
    'thy part; That man that can fight, in him I delight, And love him with '
    'all my whole heart. ',
    'Then Robin Hood setting his horn to his mouth, A blast he merrily blows; '
    'His yeomen did hear, and strait did appear, A hundred, with trusty long '
    'bows. ',
    'Now Little John came at the head of them all, Cloathd in a rich mantle of '
    'green; And likewise the rest were gloriously drest, A delicate sight to '
    'be seen. ',
    "`Lo, these are my yeomen,' said Robin Hood, `And thou shalt be one of the "
    "train; A mantle and bow, a quiver also, I give them whom I entertain.' ",
    'The forester willingly enterd the list, They were such a beautiful sight; '
    'Then with a long bow they shot a fat doe, And made a rich supper that '
    'night. ',
    'What singing and dancing was in the green wood, For joy of another new '
    "mate! With mirth and delight they spent the long night, And liv'd at a "
    'plentiful rate.  The forester neer was so merry before As then he was '
    'with these brave souls, Who never would fail, in wine, beer, or ale, To '
    'take off their cherishing bowls. ',
    'Then Robin Hood gave him a mantle of green, Broad arrows, and a curious '
    'long bow; This done, the next day, so gallant and gay, He marched them '
    'all on a row. ',
    'Quoth he, My brave yeomen, be true to your trust, And then we may range '
    "the woods wide: They all did declare, and solemnly swear, They'd conquer, "
    'or die by his side.']

    'By chance he met two troublesome blades, Two troublesome blades they '
    'chanced to be; The one of them was bold Robin Hood, And the other was '

    "`O pedlar, pedlar, what is in thy pack? Come speedilie and tell to me:' "

    "`O nay, o nay,' says the pedlar bold, `O nay, o nay, that never can be; "
    "For there's never a man from fair Nottingham Can take one half my pack "
    "from me.' ",
    'Then the pedlar he pulled off his pack, And put it a little below his '

    'shall gang with thee. ',
    'Then Little John he drew his sword, The pedlar by his pack did stand; '
    'They fought until they both did sweat, Till he cried, Pedlar, pray hold '
    'your hand! ',
    'Then Robin Hood he was standing by, And he did laugh most heartilie; '
    'Saying, I could find a man, of a smaller scale, Could thrash the pedlar '
    'and also thee. ',
    "`Go you try, master,' says Little John, `Go you try, master, most "

[   'COME light and listen, you gentlemen all, Hey down, down, and a down That '
    "mirth do love for to hear, And a story true I'le tell unto you, If that "
    'you will but draw near. ',
    'In elder times, when merriment was, And archery was holden good, There '
    'was an outlaw, as many did know, Which men called Robin Hood. ',
    'Vpon a time it chanced so Bold Robin was merry disposed, His time to '
    'spend he did intend, Either with friends or foes. ',
    'Then he got vp on a gallant brave steed, The which was worth angels ten; '
    'With a mantle of green, most brave to be seen, He left all his merry '
    'men. ',
    'And riding towards fair Nottingham, Some pastime for to spy, There was he '
    'aware of a jolly beggar As ere he beheld with his eye. ',
    'An old patcht coat the beggar had on, Which he daily did vse for to wear; '
    'And many a bag about him did wag, Which made Robin Hood to him repair. ',
    "`God speed, God speed,' said Robin Hood, `What countryman? tell to me:' "
    "`I am Yorkeshire, sir; but, ere you go far, Some charity give vnto me.' ",
    "`Why, what wouldst thou have?' said Robin Hood, `I pray thee tell vnto "
    "me:' `No lands nor livings,' the beggar he said, `But a penny for "
    "charitie.' ",
    "`I have no money,' said Robin Hood then, `But, a ranger within the wood, "
    'I am an outlaw, as many do know, My name it is Robin Hood. ',
    '`But yet I must tell thee, bonny beggar,   That a bout with thee I must '
    'try; Thy coat of gray, lay down I say, And my mantle of green shall lye '
    "by.' ",
    "`Content, content,' the beggar he cry'd, `Thy part it will be the worse; "
    "For I hope this to give thee the rout, And the have at thy purse.' ",
    'The beggar he had a mickle long staffe, And Robin had a nut-brown sword; '
    'So the beggar drew nigh, and at Robin let fly, But gave him never a '
    'word. ',
    "`Fight on, fight on,' said Robin Hood then, `This game well pleaseth me;' "
    'For every blow that Robin did give, The beggar gave buffets three. ',
    'And fighting there full hard and sore, Not far from Nottingham town, They '
    "never fled, till from Robin<'s head The blood came trickling down. ",
    "`O hold thy hand,' said Robin Hood then, `And thou and I will agree;' `If "
    "that be true,' the beggar he said, `Thy mantle come give vnto me.' ",
    "`Nay a change, a change,' cri'd Robin Hood; `Thy bags and coat give me, "
    "And this mantle of mine I'le to thee resign, My horse and my braverie.' ",
    'When Robin Hood had got the beggars clothes, He looked round about; '
    "`Methinks,' said he, `I seem to be A beggar brave and stout. ",
    '`For now I have a bag for my bread, So have I another for corn; I have '
    'one for salt, and another for malt, And one for my little horn. ',
    "`And now I will a begging goe, Some charitie for to find:' And if any "
    "more of Robin you'l know, In this second part it's behind. ",
    'Now Robin he is to Nottingham bound, With his bags hanging down to his '
    'knee, His staff, and his coat, scarce worth a groat, Yet merrilie passed '
    'he. ',
    'As Robin he passed the streets along, He heard a pittifull cry; Three '
    'brethren deer, as he did hear, Condemned were to dye.  Then Robin he '
    'highed to the sheriffs house,   Some reliefe for to seek; He skipt, and '
    'leapt, and capored full high, As he went along the street. ',
    'But when to the sheriffs doore he came, There a gentleman fine and brave, '
    "`Thou beggar,' said he, 'Come tell vnto me What is it that thou wouldest "
    "have?' ",
    "`No meat, nor drink,' said Robin Hood then, `That I come here to crave; "
    "But to beg the lives of yeomen three, And that I fain would have.' ",
    '`That cannot be, thou bold beggar, Their fact it is so cleer; I tell to '
    "thee, hanged they must be, For stealing of our kings deer.' ",
    'But when to the gallows they did come, There was many a weeping eye: `O '
    "hold your peace,' said Robin then, `For certainly they shall not dye.' ",
    'Then Robin he set his horn to his mouth, And he blew but blastes three, '
    'Till a hundred bold archers brave Came kneeling down to his knee. ',
    "`What is your will, master?' they said, `We are here at your command:' "
    "`Shoot east, shoot west,' said Robin Hood then, `And look that you spare "
    "no man.' ",
    'Then they shot east, and they shot west; Their arrows were so keen The '
    'sheriffe he, and his companie, No longer must be seen. ',
    'Then he stept to these brethren three, And away he had them tane; But the '
    'sheriff was crost, and many a man lost, That dead lay on the plain. ',
    'And away they went into the merry green wood, And sung with a merry glee, '
    'And Robin took these brethren good To be of his yeomandrie.']

[   "LYTH and listen, gentlemen, That's come of high born blood; I'll tell you "
    'of a brave booting That befel Robin Hood. ',
    'Robin Hood upon a day, He went forth him alone, And as he came from '
    'Barnesdale Into a fair evening, ',
    'He met a beggar on the way,   That sturdily could gang; He had a '
    'pike-staff in his hand, That was baith stark and strang. ',
    'A clouted cloak about him was, That held him from the cold; The thinnest '
    'bit of it, I guess, Was more than twenty fold. ',
    'His meal-pock hang about his neck, Into a leathern fang, Well fasteneg '
    'with a broad buckle, That was both stark and strang. ',
    'He had three hats upon his head, Together sticked fast; He cared neither '
    'for wind nor weet, In lands wherever he past. ',
    'Good Robin coost him in his way, To see what he might be; If any beggar '
    'had money, He thought some part had he. ',
    "`Tarry, tarry,' good Robin says, `Tarry, and speak with me;' He heard him "
    'as he heard him not, And fast his way can hie. ',
    "`It be's not so,' says good Robin, `Nay, thou must tarry still;' `By my "
    "troth,' says the bold beggar, `Of that I have no will. ",
    "R'rit is far to my lodging-house, And it is growing late; If they have "
    "supt ere I come in, I will look wondrous blate.' ",
    "`Now, by my troth,' says good Robin, `I see well by thy fare, If thou "
    'chear well to thy supper, Of mine thou takes no care; ',
    '`Who wants my dinner all the day, And wots not where to lie, And should I '
    'to the tavern go, I want money to buy. ',
    "`Sir, thou must lend me some money, Till we two meet again:' The beggar "
    'answerd cankerdly, I have no money to lend. ',
    'Thou art as young a man as I, And seems to be as sweer; If thou fast till '
    'thou get from me, Thou shalt eat none this year. ',
    "`Now, by my troth,' says good Robin,   `Since we are sembled so, If thou "
    "have but a small farthing, I'll have it ere thou go. ",
    'Therefore, lay down thy clouted cloak, And do no longer stand, And loose '
    "the strings of all thy pocks: I'll ripe them with my hand. ",
    '`And now to thee I make a vow, If thou make any din, I shall see if a '
    "broad arrow Can pierce a beggar's skin.' ",
    "The beggar smil'd, and answer made: Far better let me be; Think not that "
    'I will be afraid For thy nip crooked tree. ',
    'Or that I fear thee any whit For thy curn nips of sticks; I know no use '
    'for them so meet As to be pudding-pricks. ',
    "Here I defy thee to do me ill, For all thy boistrous fare; Thou's get "
    'nothing from me but ill, Would thou seek it evermair. ',
    'Good Robin bent his noble bow---- He was an angry man---- And in it set a '
    "broad arrow; Yet er 'twas drawn a span, ",
    'The beggar, with his noble tree, Reacht him so round a rout That his bow '
    'and his broad arrow In flinders flew about. ',
    'Good Robin bound him to his brand, But that provd likewise vain; The '
    'beggar lighted on his hand With his pike-staff again. ',
    'I wot he might not draw a sword For forty days and more; Good Robin could '
    'not speak a word, His heart was never so sore. ',
    'He could not fight, he could not flee, He wist not what to do; The '
    'beggar, with his noble tree, Laid lusty flaps him to. ',
    'He paid good Robin back and side, And beft him up and down, And with his '
    'pike-staff still on laid Till he fell in a swoon. ',
    "`Fy! stand up, man,' the beggar said,   `'Tis shame to go to rest; Stay "
    'still till thou get thy mony told, I think it were the best. ',
    '`And syne go to the tavern-house, And buy both wine and ale; Hereat thy '
    "friends will crack full crouse, Thou has been at a dale.' ",
    'Good Robin answerd never a word, But lay still as a stane; His cheeks '
    'were white as any clay, And closed were his eyne. ',
    'The beggar thought him dead but fail, And boldly bownd away; I would you '
    'had been at the dale, And gotten part of the play. ',
    "Now three of Robin's men, by chance, Came walking on the way, And found "
    'their master in a trance, On ground where he did lie. ',
    'Up have they taken good Robin, Making a piteous bier, Yet saw they no man '
    'there at whom They might the matter spear. ',
    'They looked him all round about, But wounds on him saw none, Yet at his '
    'mouth came bocking out The blood of a good vein. ',
    'Cold water they have taken syne, And cast into his face; Then he began to '
    'lift his eyne, And spake within short space. ',
    "`Tell us, dear master,' says his men, `How with you stands the case?' "
    'Good Robin sighd ere he began To tell of his disgrace. ',
    '`I have been watchman in this wood Near hand this forty year, Yet I was '
    'never so hard bestead As you have found me here. ',
    '`A beggar with a clouted cloak, In whom I feard no ill, Hath with a '
    "pike-staff clawed my back; I fear 't shall never be well. ",
    '`See, where he goes out oer yon hill, With hat upon his head; If ever you '
    'lovd your master well, Go now revenge this deed. ',
    '`And bring him back again to me,   If it lie in your might, That I may '
    'see, before I die, Him punisht in my sight. ',
    '`And if you may not bring him back, Let him not go loose on; For to us '
    "all it were great shame If he escapt again.' ",
    "`One of us shall with you remain, Because you're ill at ease; The other "
    "two shall bring him back, To use him as you please.' ",
    "`Now, by my troth,' says good Robin, `I trow there's enough said; If he "
    "get scouth to weild his tree, I fear you'll both be paid.' ",
    '`Be ye not feard, our good master, That we two can be dung With any '
    'blutter base beggar, That hath nought but a rung. ',
    '`His staff shall stand him in no stead; That you shall shortly see; But '
    'back again he shall be led, And fast bound shall he be, To see if you '
    "will have him slain, Or hanged on a tree.' ",
    '`But cast you slily in his way, Before he be aware, And on his pike-staff '
    "first lay hands; You'll speed the better far.' ",
    'Now leave we Robin with his man, Again to play the child, And learn '
    'himself to stand and gang By haulds, for all his eild. ',
    'Now pass we to the bold beggar, That raked oer the hill, Who never mended '
    'his pace no more Nor he had done no ill. ',
    'The young men knew the country well, So soon where he would be, And they '
    'have taken another way, Was nearer by miles three. ',
    "They rudely ran with all their might, Spar'd neither dub nor mire, They "
    'stirred neither at laigh nor hight, No travel made them tire, ',
    'Till they before the beggar wan, And coost them in his way; A little wood '
    'lay in a glen, And there they both did stay.   ',
    'They stood up closely by a tree, In ilk side of the gate, Until the '
    'beggar came them to, That thought not of such fate. ',
    'And as he was betwixt them past, They leapt upon him baith; The one his '
    'pike-staff gripped fast, They feared for its scaith. ',
    'The other he held in his sight A drawn dirk to his breast, And said, '
    'False carl, quit thy staff, Or I shall be thy priest. ',
    'His pike-staff they have taken him frae, And stuck it in the green; He '
    'was full leath to let it gae, If better might have been. ',
    'The beggar was the feardest man Of one that ever might be; To win away no '
    'way he can, Nor help him with his tree. ',
    'He wist not wherefore he was tane, Nor how many was there; He thought his '
    'life-days had been gone, And grew into despair. ',
    "`Grant me my life,' the beggar said, `For him that died on tree, And take "
    "away that ugly knife, Or then for fear I'll die. ",
    '`I grievd you never in all my life, By late nor yet by ayre; Ye have '
    "great sin,if ye should slay A silly poor beggar.' ",
    "`Thou lies, false lown,' they said again, `By all that may be sworn; Thou "
    'hast near slain the gentlest man That ever yet was born. ',
    '`And back again thou shalt be led, And fast bound shalt thou be, To see '
    "if he will have thee slain, Or hanged on a tree.' ",
    'The beggar then thought all was wrong; They were set for his wrack; He '
    'saw nothing appearing then But ill upon worse back. ',
    'Were he out of their hands, he thought, And had again his tree, He should '
    'not be had back for nought, With such as he did see.   ',
    'Then he bethought him on a wile, If it could take effect, How he the '
    'young men might beguile, And give them a begeck. ',
    'Thus for to do them shame or ill His beastly breast was bent; He found '
    'the wind grew something shril, To further his intent. ',
    'He said, Brave gentlemen, be good, And let the poor man be; When ye have '
    "taken a beggar's blood, It helps you not a flee. ",
    'It was but in my own defence, If he hath gotten skaith; But I will make a '
    'recompence, Much better for you baith. ',
    'If ye will set me safe and free, And do me no danger, An hundred pounds I '
    'will you give, And much more good silver, ',
    'That I have gathered these many years, Under this clouted cloak, And hid '
    'up wonder privately, In bottom of my pock. ',
    'The young men to a council yeed, And let the beggar gae; They wist how '
    'well he had no speed From them to run away. ',
    'They thought they would the money take, Come after what so may, And then '
    'they would not bring him back, But in that part him slay. ',
    'By that good Robin would not know That they had gotten coin; It would '
    'content him for to show That there they had him slain. ',
    'They said, False carl, soon have done And tell forth that money; For the '
    "ill turn thou hast done 'Tis but a simple fee. ",
    'And yet we will not have thee back, Come after what so may, If thou will '
    'do that which thou spake, And make us present pay. ',
    'O then loosd his clouted cloak, And spread it on the ground, And thereon '
    'he laid many a pock, Betwixt them and the wind.   ',
    'He took a great bag from his hase; It was near full of meal; Two pecks in '
    'it at least there was, And more, I wot full well. ',
    'Upon his cloak he laid it down, The mouth he opend wide, To turn the same '
    "he made him bown, The young men ready spy'd. ",
    'In every hand he took a nook Of that great leathern meal, And with a '
    'fling the meal he shook Into their faces hail. ',
    'Wherewith he blinded them so close A stime they could not see; And then '
    'in heart he did rejoice, And clapt his lusty tree. ',
    'He thought, if he had done them wrong In mealing of their cloaths, For to '
    'strike off the meal again With his pike-staff he goes. ',
    'Or any one of them could red their eyne, Or yet a glimmering could see, '
    'Ilk ane of them a dozen had, Well laid on with the tree. ',
    'The young men were right swift of foot, And boldly ran away; The beggar '
    'could them no more hit, For all the haste he may. ',
    "`What ails this haste?' the beggar said, `May ye not tarry still, Until "
    "your money be receivd? I'll pay you with good will. ",
    '`The shaking of my pocks, I fear, Hath blown into your eyne; But I have a '
    "good pike-staff here Will ripe them out full clean.' ",
    'The young men answerd neer a word, They were dumb as a stane; In the '
    'thick wood the beggar fled, Eer they riped their eyne. ',
    'And syne the night became so late, To seek him was but vain: But judge '
    'ye, if they looked blate When they came home again. ',
    'Good Robin speard how they had sped; They answerd him, Full ill; `That '
    "cannot be,' good Robin says; `Ye have been at the mill.   ",
    '`The mill is a meatrif place, They may lick what they please; Most like '
    "ye have been at that art, Who would look to your cloaths.' ",
    'They hangd their heads, and droped down, A word they could not speak: '
    "Robin said, Because I fell a-swoon, I think you'll do the like. ",
    'Tell on the matter, less and more, And tell me what and how Ye have done '
    'with the bold beggar I sent you for right now. ',
    'And then they told him to an end, As I have said before, How that the '
    'beggar did them blind, What misters process more. ',
    "And how he lin'd their shoulders broad With his great trenchen tree, And "
    'how in the thick wood he fled, Eer they a stime could see. ',
    'And how they scarcely could win home, Their bones were beft so sore: Good '
    "Robin cry'd, Fy! out, for shame! We're sham'd for evermore. ",
    "Altho good Robin would full fain Of his wrong revenged be, He smil'd to "
    'see his merry young men Had gotten a taste of the tree.']

[   'ALL gentlemen and yeomen good, Down a down a down a down I wish you to '
    'draw near; For a story of gallant brave Robin Hood Vnto you I wil '
    'declare. Down, etc. ',
    'As Robin Hood walkt the forrest along, Some pastime for to spie, There '
    'was he aware of a jolly shepherd, That on the ground did lie. ',
    "`Arise, arise,' cryed jolly Robin, `And now come let me see What is in "
    "thy bag and bottle, I say; Come tell it unto me.' ",
    "`What's that to thee, thou proud fellow? Tell me as I do stand What thou "
    "hast to do with my bag and bottle? Let me see thy command.' ",
    '`My sword, which hangeth by my side, Is my command I know;   Come, and '
    "let me taste of thy bottle, Or it may breed thee wo.' ",
    '`Tut, the devil a drop, thou proud fellow, Of my bottle thou shalt see, '
    "Untill thy valour here be tried, Whether thou wilt fight or flee.' ",
    "`What shall we fight for?' cries bold Robin Hood; `Come tell it soon to "
    "me; Here is twenty pounds in good red gold; Win it, and take it thee.' ",
    'The Shepherd stood all in a maze, And knew not what to say: `I have no '
    "money, thou proud fellow, But bag and bottle I'le lay.' ",
    '`I am content, thou shepherd-swain, Fling them down on the ground; But it '
    "will breed thee mickle pain, To win my twenty pound.' ",
    '`Come draw thy sword, thou proud fellow, Thou stands too long to prate; '
    "This hook of mine shall let thee know A coward I do hate.' ",
    'So they fell to it, full hardy and sore; It was in a summers day; From '
    'ten till four in the afternoon The Shepherd held him play. ',
    'Robins buckler proved his chief defence, And saved him many a bang, For '
    'every blow the Shepherd gave Made Robins sword cry twang.  Many a sturdy '
    'blow the Shepherd gave, And that bold Robin found, Till the blood ran '
    'trickling from his head; Then he fell to the ground. ',
    '`Arise, arise, thou proud fellow, And thou shalt have fair play, If thou '
    "wilt yield, before thou go, That I have won the day.' ",
    "`A boon, a boon,' cried bold Robin; `If that a man thou be, Then let me "
    "take my beaugle-horn, And blow but blasts three.' ",
    "`To blow three times three,' the Shepherd said, `I will not thee deny; "

    'calld aloud to those bold outlaws, And charged them to stand. ',
    "`Why, who are you,' cry'd bold Robin, `That speaks so boldly here?' `We "
    "three belong to King Henry, And are keepers of his deer.' ",

    '`Come, your coats of green lay on the ground, And so will we all three, '
    "And take your swords and bucklers round, And try the victory.' ",
    "`We be content,' the keepers said, R'rwe be three, and you no less; Then "
    "why should we be of you afraid, And we never did transgress?' ",
    '`Why, if you be three keepers in this forest, Then we be three rangers '
    'good, And we will make you to know, before you do go, You meet with bold '
    "Robin Hood.' ",

    'prate, But let us try it out with blows, For cowards we do hate.   ',
    '`Here is one of us for Will Scarlock, And another for Little John, And I '
    "my self for Robin Hood, Because he is stout and strong.' ",
    'So they fell to it full hard and sore; It was on a midsummers day; From '
    'eight a clock till two and past, They all shewed gallant play. ',
    'There Robin, and Will, and Little John, They fought most manfully, Till '
    'all their winde was spent and gone, Then Robin aloud did cry: ',

    "`That bargain's to make, bold Robin Hood, Therefore we it deny; Though a "

    '`Therefore fall on, or else be gone, And yield to us the day: It shall '
    "never be said that we were afraid Of thee, nor thy yeomen gay.' ",
    "`If that be so,' cries bold Robin, `Let me but know your names, And in "
    "the forest of merry Sheerwood I shall extol your fames.' ",
    "`And with our names,' one of them said, `What hast thou here to do? "
    "Except that you will fight it out, Our names thou shalt not know.' ",
    "`We will fight no more,' sayes bold Robin, `You be men of valour stout; "
    'Come and go with me to Nottingham, And there we will fight it out. ',

    'We will be sharers now all alike Of the mony that we have; And there is '
    'never a one of us That his fellows shall deceive. ',
    'The priests their hands in their pockets put, But mony would find none: '
    "`We'l search our selves,' said Robin Hood, `Each other, one by one.' ",
    'Then Robin took pains to search them both, And he found good store of '
    'gold; Five hundred peeces presently Vpon the grass was told. ',
    "`Here is a brave show,' said Robin Hood, `Such store of gold to see, And "
    "you shall each one have a part, Cause you prayed so heartily.' ",
    'He gave them fifty pound a-peece, And the rest for himself did keep; The '
    'priests durst not speak one word, Bur they sighed wondrous deep. ',
    'With that the priests rose up from their knees, Thinking to have parted '
    "so; `Nay, stay,' said Robin Hood, 'one thing more I have to say ere you "
    'go. ',
    "`You shall be sworn,' said bold Robin Hood, `Vpon this holy grass, That "
    'you will never tell lies again, Which way soever you pass.   ',
    '`The second oath that you here must take, All the days of your lives You '
    'never shall tempt maids to sin, Nor lye with other mens wives. ',
    '`The last oath you shall take, it is this, Be charitable to the poor; Say '
    "you have met with a holy fryer, And I desire no more.' ",
    'He set them upon their horses again, And away then they did ride; And hee '
    'returnd to the merry green-wood, With great joy, mirth and pride.']

[   'IN summer time, when leaves grow green, When they doe grow both green and '
    'long, Of a bould outlaw, calld Robin Hood, It is of him I sing this '
    'song. ',
    'When the lilly leafe and the elephant Doth bud and spring with a merry '
    'good cheere, This outlaw was weary of the wood-side, And chasing of the '
    'fallow deere. ',
    '`The fishermen brave more mony have Then any merchant, two or three; '
    "Therefore I will to Scarborough goe, That I a fisherman brave may be.' ",
    'This outlaw calld his merry men all, As they sate under the green-wood '
    'tree: `If any of you have gold to spend, I pray you heartily spend it '
    'with me. ',
    "`Now,' quoth Robin, I'le to Scarborough goe, It seemes to be a very faire "
    "day;' Who tooke up his inne at a widdow-womans house, Hard by upon the "
    'water gray. ',
    'Who asked of him, Where wert thou borne? Or tell to me, where dost thou '
    "fare? `I am a poore fisherman,' saith he then, `This day intrapped all in "

    "`What is thy name, thou fine fellow? I pray thee heartily tell to me;' "
    '`In mine own country where I was borne, Men called me Simon over the '
    "Lee.' ",
    "`Simon, Simon,' said the good wife, The outlaw was ware of her courtesie, "
    'And rejoyed he had got such a dame. ',
    "`Simon, wilt thou be my man? And good round wages I'le give thee; I have "
    'as good a ship of mine owne As any sayle upon the sea.   ',
    '`Anchors and planks thou shalt want none, Masts and ropes that are so '
    "long;' `And if that you thus furnish me,' Said Simon, 'Nothing shall goe "
    "wrong.' ",
    'They pluckt up anchor, and away did sayle, More of a day then two or '

    "`O woe is me,' said Simon then, `This day that ever I came here! I wish I "

    '`For your French robbers on the sea, They will not spare of us one man, '
    "But carry us to the coast of France, And ligge us in the prison strong.' ",

    '`Hold thy peace, thou long lubber, For thou art nought but braggs and '

[   'KIND gentlemen, will you be patient awhile? Ay, and then you shall hear '
    'anon A very good ballad of bold Robin Hood, And of his man, brave Little '
    'John. ',
    'In Locksly town, in Nottinghamshire, In merry sweet Locksly town, There '
    'bold Robin Hood he was born and  was bred, Bold Robin of famous renown. ',
    'The father of Robin a forester was, And he shot in a lusty long bow, Two '
    'north country miles and an inch at a shot, As the Pinder of Wakefield '
    'does know. ',
    'For he brought Adam Bell, and Clim of the Clugh, And William a Clowdesle '
    'To shoot with our forrester for forty mark, And the forrester beat them '
    'all three. ',
    'His mother was neece to the Coventry knight, Which Warwickshire men call '
    'Sir Guy; For he slew the blue bore that hangs up at the gate, Or mine '
    'host of The Bull tells a lye.   ',
    'Her brother was Gamwel, of Great Gamwel Hall, And a noble house-keeper '
    'was he, Ay, as ever broke bread in sweet Nottinghamshire, And a squire of '
    'famous degree. ',
    'The mother of Robin said to her husband, My honey, my love, and my dear, '
    'Let Robin and I ride this morning to Gamwel, To taste of my brothers good '
    'cheer. ',
    'And he said, I grant thee thy boon, gentle Joan, Take one of my horses, I '
    'pray; The sun is a rising, and therefore make haste, For to-morrow is '
    'Christmas-day. ',
    'Then Robin Hoods fathers grey gelding was brought, And sadled and bridled '
    'was he; God wot, a blew bonnet, his new suit of cloaths, And a cloak that '
    'did reach to his knee. ',
    'She got on her holiday kirtle and gown, They were of a light Lincoln '
    'green; The cloath was homespun, but for colour and make It might a '
    'beseemed our queen. ',
    'And then Robin got on his basket-hilt sword, And his dagger on his tother '
    "side, And said, My dear mother, let's haste to be gone, We have forty "
    'long miles to ride. ',
    'When Robin had mounted his gelding so grey, His father, without any '
    'trouble, Set her up behind him, and bad her not fear, For his gelding had '
    'oft carried double. ',
    'And when she was settled, they rode to their neighbours, And drank and '
    'shook hands with them all; And then Robin gallopt, and never gave ore, '
    'Till they lighted at Gamwel Hall. ',
    'And now you may think the right worshipful squire Was joyful his sister '
    'to see; For he kist her and kist her, and swore a great oath, Thou art '
    'welcome, kind sister, to me. ',
    'To-morrow, when mass had been said in the chappel, Six tables were coverd '
    'in the hall, And in comes the squire, and makes a short speech, It was, '
    "Neighbours, you're welcome all. ",
    'But not a man here shall taste my March beer, Till a Christmas carrol he '
    'sing: Then all clapt their hands, and they shouted and sung, Till the '
    'hall and the parlour did ring. ',
    'Now mustard and braun, roast beef and plumb pies, Were set upon every '
    'table: And noble George Gamwel said, Eat and be merry, And drink too, as '
    "long as you're able.   ",
    'When dinner was ended, his chaplain said grace, And, `Be merry, my '
    "friends,' said the squire; `It rains, and it blows, but call for more "
    'ale, And lay some more wood on the fire. ',
    '`And now call ye Little John hither to me, For Little John is a fine lad '
    'At gambols and juggling, and twenty such tricks As shall make you merry '
    "and glad.' ",
    'When Little John came, to gambols they went, Both gentleman, yeoman and '
    'clown; And what do you think?  Why, as true as I live, Bold Robin Hood '
    'put them all down. ',
    'And now you may think the right worshipful squire Was joyful this sight '
    "for to see; For he said, Cousin Robin, thou'st go no more home, But tarry "
    'and dwell here with me. ',
    'Thou shalt have my land when I dye, and till then Thou shalt be the staff '
    "of my age; `Then grant me my boon, dear uncle,' said Robin, `That Little "
    "John may be my page.' ",
    'And he said, Kind cousin, I grant thee thy boon; With all my heart, so '
    "let it be; `Then come hither, Little John,' said Robin Hood, `Come "
    'hither, my page, unto me. ',
    '`Go fetch my bow, my longest long bow, And broad arrows, one, two, or '
    "three; For when it is fair weather we'll into Sherwood, Some merry "
    "pastime to see.' ",
    'When Robin Hood came into merry Sherwood, He winded his bugle so clear, '
    'And twice five and twenty good yeomen and bold Before Robin Hood did '
    'appear. ',
    "`Where are your companions all?' said Robin Hood, `For still I want forty "
    "and three;' Then said a bold yeoman, Lo, yonder they stand, All under a "
    'green-wood tree. ',
    'As that word was spoke, Clorinda came by; The queen of the shepherds was '
    'she; And her gown was of velvet as green as the grass, And her buskin did '
    'reach to her knee. ',
    'Her gait it was graceful, her body was straight, And her countenance free '
    'from pride; A bow in her hand, and quiver and arrows Hung dangling by her '
    'sweet side. ',
    'Her eye-brows were black, ay, and so was her hair, And her skin was as '
    'smooth as glass; Her visage spoke wisdom, and modesty too; Sets with '
    'Robin Hood such a lass!   ',
    'Said Robin Hood, Lady fair, whither away? O whither, fair lady, away? And '
    'she made him answer, To kill a fat buck; For to-morrow is Titbury day. ',
    'Said Robin Hood, Lady fair, wander with me A little to yonder green '
    'bower; There sit down to rest you, and you shall be sure Of a brace or a '
    'lease in  an hour. ',
    'And as we were going towards the green bower, Two hundred good bucks we '
    "espy'd; She chose out the fattest that was in the herd, And she shot him "
    'through side and side. ',
    "`By the faith of my body,' said bold Robin Hood, `I never saw woman like "
    'thee; And comst thou from east, ay, or comst thou from west, Thou needst '
    'not beg venison of me. ',
    '`However, along to my bower you shall go, And taste of a forresters '
    "meat:' And when we come thither, we found as good cheer As any man needs "
    'for to eat. ',
    'For there was hot venison, and warden pies cold, Cream clouted, with '
    'honey-combs plenty; And the sarvitors they were, beside Little John, Good '
    'yeomen at least four and twenty. ',
    "Clorinda said, Tell me your name, gentle sir; And he said, 'Tis bold "
    "Robin Hood: Squire Gamwel's my uncle, but all my delight Is to dwell in "
    'the merry Sherwood. ',
    "For 'tis a fine life, and 'tis void of all strife. `So 'tis, sir,' "
    "Clorinda reply'd; `But oh,' said bold Robin, 'How sweet would it be, If "
    "Clorinda would be my bride!' ",
    'She blusht at the motion; yet, after a pause Said, Yes, sir, and with all '
    "my heart; `Then let's send for a priest,' said Robin Hood, `And be "
    "married before we do part.' ",
    'But she said, It may not be so, gentle sir, For I must be at Titbury '
    "feast; And if Robin Hood will go thither with me, I'll make him the most "
    'welcome guest. ',
    "Said Robin Hood, Reach me that buck, Little John, For I'll go along with "
    'my dear; Go bid my yeomen kill six brace of bucks, And meet me to-morrow '
    'just here. ',
    'Before we had ridden five Staffordshire miles, Eight yeomen, that were '
    'too bold, Bid Robin Hood stand, and deliver his buck; A truer tale never '
    'was told.   ',
    "`I will not, faith!' said bold Robin: 'Come, John, Stand to me, and we'll "
    "beat em all:' Then both drew their swords, an so cut em and slasht em "
    'That five of them did fall. ',
    'The three that remaind calld to Robin for quarter, And pitiful John beggd '
    "their lives; When John's boon was granted, he gave them good counsel, And "
    'so sent them home to their wives. ',
    'This battle was fought near to Titbury town, When the bagpipes bated the '
    "bull; I am king of the fidlers, and sware 'tis a truth, And I call him "
    'that doubts it a gull. ',
    'For I saw them fighting, and fidld the while, And Clorinda sung, Hey '
    "derry down! The bumpkins are beaten, put up thy sword,Bob, And now let's "
    'dance into the town. ',
    'Before we came to it, we heard a strange shouting, And all that were in '
    'it lookd madly; For some were a bull-back, some dancing a morris, And '
    'some singing Arthur-a-Bradly. ',
    'And there we see Thomas, our justices clerk, And Mary, to whom he was '
    'kind; For Tom rode before her, and calld Mary, Madam, And kist her full '
    'sweetly behind. ',
    'And so may your worships.  But we went to dinner, With Thomas and Mary '
    'and Nan; They all drank a health to Clorinda, and told her Bold Robin '
    'Hood was a fine man. ',
    'When dinner was ended, Sir Roger, the parson Of Dubbridge, was sent for '
    'in haste; He brought his mass-book, and he bade them take hands, And he '
    'joynd them in marriage full fast. ',
    'And then, as bold Robin Hood and his sweet bride Went hand in hand to the '
    "green bower, The birds sung with pleasure in merry Sherwood, And 'twas a "
    'most joyful hour. ',
    "And when Robin came in the sight of the bower, `Where are my yeomen?' "
    'said he; And Little John answered, Lo, yonder they stand, All under the '
    'green-wood tree. ',
    "Then a garland they brought her, by two and by two, And plac'd them upon "
    "the bride's head; The music struck up, and we all fell to dance, Till the "
    'bride and the groom were a-bed. ',
    'And what they did there must be counsel to me, Because they lay long the '
    'next day, And I had haste home, but I got a good piece Of the bride-cake, '
    'and so came away.   ',
    'Now out, alas!  I had forgotten to tell ye That marryd they were with a '
    'ring; And so will Nan Knight, or be buried a maiden, And now let us pray '
    'for the king: ',
    'That he may get children, and they may get more, To govern and do us some '
    "good; And then I'll make ballads in Robin Hood's bower, And sing em in "
    'merry Sherwood.']

[   'A BONNY fine maid of a noble degree, With a hey down down a down down '
    'Maid Marian calld by name, Did live in the North, of excellent worth, For '
    'she was a gallant dame. ',
    'For favour and face, and beauty most rare, Queen Hellen shee did excell; '
    'For Marian then was praisd of all men That did in the country dwell. ',
    "'Twas neither Rosamond nor Jane Shore, Whose beauty was clear and bright, "
    'That could surpass this country lass, Beloved of lord and knight. ',
    'The Earl of Huntington, nobly born, That came of noble blood, To Marian '
    'went, with a good intent, By the name of Robin Hood. ',
    'With kisses sweet their red lips meet, For shee and the earl did agree; '
    'In every place, they kindly imbrace, With love and sweet unity. ',
    'But fortune bearing these lovers a spight, That soon they were forced to '
    'part, To the merry green wood then went Robin Hood, With a sad and '
    'sorrowfull heart. ',
    'And Marian, poor soul, was troubled in mind, For the absence of her '
    'friend; With finger in eye, shee often did cry, And his person did much '
    'commend. ',
    'Perplexed and vexed, and troubled in mind, Shee drest her self like a '
    'page, And ranged the wood to find Robin Hood, The bravest of men in that '
    'age. ',
    'With quiver and bow, sword, buckler, and all, Thus armed was Marian most '
    'bold, Still wandering about to find Robin  out, Whose person was better '

    'But Robin Hood, hee himself had disguisd, And Marian was strangly '
    "attir'd, That they provd foes, and so fell to blowes, Whose vallour bold "
    "Robin admir'd.   ",
    'They drew out their swords, and to cutting they went, At least an hour or '
    'more, That the blood ran apace from bold Robins face, And Marian was '
    'wounded sore. ',
    "`O hold thy hand, hold thy hand,' said Robin Hood, `And thou shalt be one "

    'cheer. ',
    'For Little John took his bow in his hand, And wandring in the wood, To '
    'kill the deer, and make good chear, For Marian and Robin Hood. ',
    'A stately banquet the<y had full soon, All in a shaded bower, Where '

    'Great flaggons of wine were set on the board, And merrily they drunk '
    'round Their boules of sack, to strengthen the back, Whilst their knees '

[   'KING RICHARD hearing of the pranks Of Robin Hood and his men, He much '
    "admir'd, and more desir'd, To see both him and them. ",
    'Then with a dozen of his lords To Nottingham he rode; When he came there, '
    'he made good cheer, And took up his abode. ',
    'He having staid there some time, But had no hopes to speed, He and his '
    "lords, with free accord, All put on monk's weeds. ",
    'From Fountain-abby they did ride, Down to barnsdale; Where Robin Hood '
    'prepare:d stood All company to assail. ',
    'The king was higher then the rest, And Robin thought he had An abbot  '
    'been whom he did spleen; To rob him he was glad. ',
    "He took the king's horse by the head, `Abbot,' says he, `abide; I am "
    "bound to rue such knaves as you, That live in pomp and pride.' ",
    "`But we are messengers from the king,' The king himself did say; `Near to "
    "this place his royal Grace To speak with thee does stay.' ",
    "`God save the king,' said Robin Hood, `And all that wish him well; He "
    "that does deny his sovereignty, I wish he was in hell.' ",
    "`O thyself thou curses,' says the king, `For thou a traitor art:' `Nay, "
    'but that you are his messenger, I swear you lie in heart. ',
    '`For I never yet hurt any man That honest is and true; But those that '
    "give their minds to live Upon other men's due. ",
    '`I never hurt the husbandman, That use to till the ground; Nor spill '
    'their blood that range the wood To follow hawk or hound. ',
    '`My chiefest spite to clergy is, Who in these days bear a great sway; '
    'With fryars and monks, with their fine sprunks, I make my chiefest '
    'prey.   ',
    "`But I am very glad,' says Robin Hood, `That I have met you here; Come, "
    "before we end, you shall, my friend, Taste of our green-wood cheer.' ",
    'The king did then marvel much, And so did all his men; They thought with '
    'fear, what kind of cheer Robin would provide for them. ',
    "Robin took the king's horse by the head, And led him to the tent; `Thou "
    "would not be so usd,' quoth he, `But that my king thee sent. ",
    "`Nay, more than that,' said Robin Hood, `For good king Richard's sake, If "
    "you had as much gold as ever I told, I would not one penny take.' ",
    'Then Robin set his horn to his mouth, And a loud blast he did blow, Till '
    "a hundred and ten of Robin Hood's men Came marching all of a row. ",
    "And when they came bold Robin before, Each man did bend his knee; `O,' "
    "thought the king, `'tis a gallant thing, And a seemly sight to see.' ",
    "Within himself the king did say, These men of Robin Hood's More humble be "
    'than mine to me; So the court may learn of the woods. ',
    'So then they all to dinner went, Upon a carpet green; Black, yellow, red, '
    'finely mingle:d, Most curious to be seen. ',
    'Venison and fowls were plenty there, With fish out of the river: King '
    'Richard swore, on sea or shore, He neer was feasted better. ',
    'Then Robin takes a can of ale: `Come, let us now begin; Come, every man '
    "shall have his can; Here's a health unto the king.' ",
    'The king himself drank to the king, So round about it went; Two barrels '
    'of ale, both stout and stale, To pledge that health were spent. ',
    'And after that, a bowl of wine In his hand took Robin Hood; `Until I die, '
    "I'll drink wine,' said he, `While I live in the green-wood.   ",
    "`Bend all your bows,' said Robin Hood, `And with the grey goose wing Such "
    "sport now shew as you would do In the presence of the king.' ",
    'They shewd such brave archery, By cleaving sticks and wands, That the '
    'king did say, Such men as they Live not in many lands. ',
    "`Well, Robin Hood,' then says the king, `If I could thy pardon get, To "
    "serve the king in every thing Wouldst thou thy mind firm set?' ",
    "`Yes, with all my heart,' bold Robin said, So they flung off their hoods; "
    'To serve the king in every thing, They swore they would spend their '
    'bloods. ',
    '`For a clergyman was first my bane, Which makes me hate them all; But if '
    "you'll be so kind to me, Love them again I shall.' ",

    "`I am the king, thy sovereign king, That appears before you all;' When "
    'Robin see that it was he, Strait then he down did fall. ',
    "`Stand up again,' then said the king, `I'll thee thy pardon give; Stand "
    "up, my friend; who can contend, When I give leave to live?' ",
    'So they are all gone to Nottingham, All shouting as they came; But when '
    'the people them did see, They thought the king was slain, ',
    'And for that cause the outlaws were come, To rule all as they list; And '
    'for to shun, which way to run The people did not wist. ',
    'The plowman left the plow in the fields, The smith ran from his shop; Old '
    'folks also, that scarce could go, Over their sticks did hop. ',
    'The king soon let them understand He had been in the green wood, And from '
    "that day, for evermore, He'd forgiven Robin Hood.   ",
    'When the people they did hear, And the truth was known, They all did '
    "sing, `God save the king! Hang care, the town's our own!' ",
    "`What's that Robin Hood?' then said the sheriff; `That varlet I do hate; "
    "Both me and mine he causd to dine, And servd us all with one plate.' ",
    "`Ho, ho,' said Robin, `I know what you mean; Come, take your gold again; "
    'Be friends with me, and I with thee, And so with every man. ',
    '`Now, master sheriff, you are paid, And since you are beginner, As well '
    'as you give me my due; For you neer paid for that dinner. ',
    '`But if that it should please the king So much your house to grace To sup '
    "with you, for to speak true, I know you neer was base.' ",
    'The sheriff could not that gain say, For a trick was put upon him; A '
    "supper was drest, the king was guest, But he thought 'twould have undone "
    'him. ',
    'They are all gone to London court, Robin Hood, with all his train; He '
    "once was there a noble peer, And now he's there again. ",
    'Many such pranks brave Robin playd While he lived in the green wood: Now, '
    'my friends, attend, and hear an end Of honest Robin Hood.']

[   'WHEN as the sheriff of Nottingham Was come, with mickle grief, He talkd '
    'no good of Robin Hood, That strong and sturdy thief. Fal lal dal de ',
    'So unto London-road he past, His losses to unfold To King Richard, who '
    'did regard The tale that he had told. ',
    "`Why,' quoth the king, 'what shall I do? Art thou not sheriff for me? The "
    'law is in force, go take thy course Of them that injure thee. ',
    '`Go get thee gone, and by thyself Devise some tricking game For to '
    "enthral yon rebels all;   Go take thy course with them.' ",
    'So away the sheriff he returnd, And by the way he thought Of the words of '
    'the king, and how the thing To pass might well be brought. ',
    'For within his mind he imagined That when such matches were, Those '
    'outlaws stout, without all doubt, Would be the bowmen there. ',
    'So an arrow with a golden head And shaft of silver white, Who won the day '
    'should bear away For his own proper right. ',
    'Tidings came to brave Robin Hood, Under the green-wood tree: `Come '
    "prepare you then, my merry men, We'll go yon sport to see.' ",
    "With that stept forth a brave young man, David of Doncaster: `Master,' "
    "said he, 'Be ruld by me, From the green-wood we'll not stir. ",
    "`To tell the truth, I'm well informed Yon match is a wile; The sheriff, I "
    "wiss, devises this Us archers to beguile.' ",
    " `O thou smells of a coward,' said Robin Hood, `Thy words does not please "
    "me; Come on't what will, I'll try my skill At yon brave archery.' ",
    'O then bespoke brave Little John: Come, let us thither gang; Come listen '
    'to me, how it shall be That we need not be kend. ',
    "Our mantles, all of Lincoln green, Behind us we will leave; We'll dress "
    'us all so several They shall not us perceive. ',
    'One shall wear white, another red, One yellow, another blue; Thus in '
    "disguise, to the exercise We'll gang, whateer ensue. ",
    'Forth from the green-wood they are gone, With hearts all firm and stout, '
    "Resolving then with the sheriff's men To have a hearty bout. ",
    'So themselves they mixed with the rest, To prevent all suspicion; For if '
    'they should together hold   They thought it no discretion. ',
    'So the sheriff looking round about, Amongst eight hundred men, But could '
    'not see the sight that he Had long expected then. ',
    'Some said, If Robin Hood was here, And all his men to boot, Sure none of '
    'them could pass these men, So bravely they do shoot. ',
    "`Ay,' quoth the sheriff, and scratchd his head, `I thought he would have "
    "been here; I thought he would, but, tho he's bold, He durst not now "
    "appear.' ",
    'O that word grieved Robin Hood to the heart; He vexe:d in his blood; Eer '
    'long, thought he, thou shalt well see That here was Robin Hood. ',
    'Some cried, Blue jacket! another cried, Brown! And the third cried, Brave '
    'Yellow! But the fourth man said, Yon man in red In this place has no '
    'fellow. ',
    'For that was Robin Hood himself, For he was cloathd in red; At every shot '
    'the prize he got, For he was both sure and dead. ',
    'So the arrow with the golden head And shaft of silver white Brave Robin '
    'Hood won, and bore with him For his own proper right. ',
    'These outlaws there, that very day, To shun all kind of doubt, By three '
    'or four, no less no more, As they went in came out. ',
    'Until they all assembled were Under the green-wood shade, Where they '
    'report, in pleasant sport, What brave pastime they made. ',
    'Says Robin Hood, All my care is, How that yon sheriff may Know certainly '
    'that it was I That bore his arrow away. ',
    'Says Little John, My counsel good Did take effect before, So therefore '
    "now, if you'll allow, I will advise once more. ",
    "`Speak on, speak on,' said Robin Hood, `Thy wit's both quick and sound; I "
    "know no man amongst us can   For wit like thee be found.' ",
    "`This I advise,' said Little John; `That a letter shall be pend, And when "
    "it is done, to Nottingham You to the sheriff shall send.' ",
    "`That is well advised,' said Robin Hood, `But how must it be sent?' "
    "`Pugh! when you please, it's done with ease, Master, be you content. ",
    "`I'll stick it on my arrow's head, And shoot it into the town; The mark "
    "shall show where it must go, When ever it lights down.' ",
    'The project it was full performd; The sheriff that letter had; Which when '
    "he read, he scratchd his head, And rav'd like one that's mad. ",
    "So we'll leave him chafing in his grease, Which will do him no good; Now, "
    'my friends, attend, and hear the end Of honest Robin Hood.']

[   'WHEN Robin Hood, and his merry men all, Derry, etc. Had reigned many '
    'years, The king was then told they had been too bold To his bishops and '
    'noble peers. Hey, etc. ',
    'Therefore they called a council of state, To know what was best to be '
    "done For to quell their pride, or else, they reply'd, The land would be "
    'over-run. ',
    'Having consulted a whole summers day, At length it was agreed That one '
    'should be sent to try the event, And fetch him away with speed. ',
    'Therefore a trusty and worthy knight The king was pleasd to call, Sir '
    'William by name; when to him he came, He told him his pleasure all. ',
    '`Go you from hence to bold Robin Hood, And bid him, without more a-do, '
    'Surrender himself, or else the proud elf Shall suffer with all his crew. ',
    '`Take here a hundred bowmen brave, All chosen men of might, Of excellent '
    "art for to take thy part, In glittering armour bright.' ",
    'Then said the knight, My sovereign  liege,   By me they shall be led; '
    "I'll venture my blood against bold Robin Hood, And bring him alive or "
    'dead. ',
    'One hundred men were chosen straight, As proper as eer men saw; On '
    'Midsummer-day the marched away, To conquer that brave outlaw. ',
    'With long yew bows and shining spears, They marchd in mickle pride, And '
    'never delayd, or halted, or stayd, Till they came to the greenwood-side. ',
    'Said he to his archers, Tarry here; Your bows make ready all, That, if '
    'need should be, you may follow me; And see you observe my call. ',
    "`I'll go in person first,' he cry'd, `With the letters of my good king, "
    'Both signd and seald, and if he will yield, We need not draw one '
    "string.' ",
    'He wanderd about till at length he came To the tent of Robin Hood; The '
    'letter he shews; bold Robin arose, And there on his guard he stood. ',
    "`They'd have me surrender,' quoth bold Robin Hood, `And lie at their "
    'mercy then; But tell them from me, that never shall be, While I have full '
    "seven-score men.' ",
    'Sir William the knight, both hardy and bold, Did offer to seize him '
    'there, Which William Locksly by fortune did see, And bid him that trick '
    'forbear. ',
    'Then Robin Hood set his horn to his mouth, And blew a blast or twain, And '
    'so did the knight, at which there in sight The archers came all amain. ',
    "Sir William with care he drew up his men, And plac'd them in battle "
    'array; Bold Robin, we find, he was not behind; Now this was a bloody '
    'fray. ',
    'The archers on both sides bent their bows, And the clouds of arrows flew; '
    'The very first flight, that honoured knight Did there bid the world '
    'adieu. ',
    'Yet nevertheless their fight did last From morning till almost noon; Both '
    'parties were stout, and loath to give out; This was on the last day of '
    'June. ',
    'At length they went off; one part they went   To London with right good '
    'will; And Robin Hood he to the green-wood tree, And there he was taken '
    'ill. ',
    'He sent for a monk, who let him blood, And took his life away; Now this '
    'being done, his archers they run, It was not a time to stay. ',
    'Some got on board and crossd the seas, To Flanders, France, and Spain, '
    'And others to Rome, for fear of their doom, But soon returnd again. ',
    'Thus he that never feard bow nor spear Was murderd by letting of blood; '
    'And so, loving friends, the story doth end Of valiant bold Robin Hood. ',

[   'BOTH gentlemen, or yeomen bould, Or whatsoever you are, To have a stately '
    'story tould, Attention now prepare. ',
    'It is a tale of Robin Hood, Which I to you will tell, Which being rightly '
    'understood, I know will please you well. ',
    'This Robbin, so much talked on, Was once a man of fame, Instiled Earle of '
    'Huntington, Lord Robert Hood by name. ',
    'In courtship and magnificence, His carriage won him prayse, And greater '
    'favor with his prince Than any in his dayes. ',
    'In bounteous liberality He too much did excell, And loved men of quality '
    'More than exceeding well. ',
    'His great revennues all he sould For wine and costly cheere;   He kept '
    'three hundred bowmen bold, He shooting loved so deare. ',
    'No archer living in his time With him might well compare; He practisd all '
    'his youthfull prime That exercise most rare. ',
    'At last, by his profuse expence, He had consumd his wealth, And being '
    'outlawed by his prince, In woods he livd by stealth. ',
    'The abbot of Siaintr Maries rich, To whom he mony ought, His hatred to '
    'this earle was such That he his downefall wrought. ',
    "So being outlawed, as 'tis told, He with a crew went forth Of lusty "
    'cutters, stout and bold, And robbed in the North. ',
    'Among the rest, one Little John, A yeoman bold and free, Who could, if it '
    'stood him upon, With ease encounter three. ',
    'One hundred men in all he got, With whom, the story sayes, Three hundred '
    'common men durst not Hold combate any wayes. ',
    'They Yorkshire woods frequented much, And Lancashire also, Wherein their '
    'practises were such That they wrought mickle woe. ',
    'None rich durst travell to and fro, Though nere so strongly armd, But by '
    'these theeves, so strong in show, They still were robd and harmd. ',
    'His chiefest spight to the clergie was, That lived in monstrous pride; No '
    'one of them he would let passe Along the high-way side, ',
    'But first they must to dinner goe, And afterwards to shrift: Full many a '
    'one he served so, Thus while he livd by theft.  No monkes nor fryers he '
    'would let goe, Without paying their fees: If they thought much to be usd '
    'so, Their stones he made them leese. ',
    'For such as they the country filld With bastards in those dayes;   Which '
    'to prevent, these sparkes did geld All that came by their wayes. ',
    'But Robbin Hood so gentle was, And bore so brave a minde, If any in '
    'distresse did passe, To them he was so kinde ',
    'That he would give and lend to them, To helpe them at their neede: This '
    'made all poore men pray for him, And wish he well might speede. ',
    'The widdow and the fatherlesse He would send meanes unto, And those whom '
    'famine did oppresse Found him a friendly foe. ',
    'Nor would he doe a woman wrong, But see her safe conveid; He would '
    "protect with power strong All those who crav'd his ayde. ",
    'The abbot of Saint Maries then, Who him undid before, Was riding with two '
    'hundred men, And gold and silver store. ',
    'But Robbin Hood upon him set With his couragious sparkes, And all the '
    'coyne perforce did get, Which was twelve thousand markes. ',
    'He bound the abbot to a tree, And would not let him passe Before that to '
    'his men and he His lordship had sayd masse. ',
    'Which being done, upon his horse He set him fast astride, And with his '
    'face towards his ar-- He forced him to ride. ',
    'His men were faine to be his guide, For he rode backward home; The abbot, '
    'being thus villifide, Did sorely chafe and fume. ',
    "Thus Robbin Hood did vindicate His former wrongs receivd; For 'twas this "
    'covetous prelate That him of land bereavd. ',
    'The abbot he rode to the king With all the haste he could, And to his '
    'Grace he every thing Exactly did unfold. ',
    'And sayd if that no course were tane, By force or stratagem,   To take '
    'this rebell and his traine, No man should passe for them. ',
    'The king protested by and by Unto the abbot then That Robbin Hood with '
    'speed should dye, With all his merry men. ',
    'But ere the king did any send, He did another feate, Which did his Grace '
    'much more offend; The fact indeed was great.  For in a short time after '
    'that, The kings receivers went Towards London with the coyne they got, '
    "For 's highnesse northerne rent. ",
    'Bold Robbin Hood and Little John, With the rest of their traine, Not '
    'dreading law, set them upon, And did their gold obtaine. ',
    'The king much moved at the same, And the abbots talke also, In this his '
    'anger did proclaime, And sent word to and fro, ',
    'That whosoere, alive or dead, Could bring him Robbin Hood, Should have '
    'one thousand markes, well payd In gold and silver good. ',
    'This promise of the king did make Full many yeomen bold Attempt stout '
    'Robbin Hood to take, With all the force they could. ',
    'But still when any came to him, Within the gay greene wood, He '
    'entertainement gave to them, With venison fat and good. ',
    'And shewd to them such martiall sport,',
    'With his long bow and arrow, That they of him did give report, How that '
    'it was great sorow, ',
    'That such a worthy man as he Should thus be put to shift, Being late a '
    'lord of high degree, Of living quite bereft. ',
    'The king, to take him, more and more Sent men of mickle might, But he and '
    'his still beate them sore, And conquered them in fight. ',
    'Or else, with love and courtesie, To him he won their hearts:   Thus '
    'still he livd by robbery, Throughout the northerne parts. ',
    "And all the country stood in  dread Of Robbin Hood and 's men; For "
    'stouter lads nere livd by bread, In those dayes nor since then. ',
    "The abbot which before I nam'd Sought all the meanes he could To have by "
    'force this rebell tane, And his adherents bold. ',
    'Therefore he armd five hundred men, With furniture compleate, But the '
    'outlawes slew halfe of them, And made the rest retreate. ',
    'The long bow and the arrow keene They were so usd unto That still they '
    "kept the forest greene, In spight o th' proudest foe. ",
    'Twelve of the abbots men he tooke, Who came him to have tane, When all '
    'the rest the field forsooke; These he did entertaine ',
    'With banquetting and merriment, And, having usd them well, He to their '
    'lord them safely sent, And willd them him to tell ',
    'That if he would be pleasd at last To beg of our good king That he might '
    'pardon what was past, And him to favour bring, ',
    'He would surrender backe agen The money which before Was taken by him and '
    'his men, From him and many more. ',
    'Poore men might safely passe by him, And some that way would chuse, For '
    'well they knew that to helpe them He evermore did use. ',
    'But where he knew a miser rich, That did the poore oppresse, To feele his '
    "coyne his hand did itch; Hee'de have it, more or lesse. ",
    'And sometimes, when the high-way fayld, Then he his courage rouses; He '
    'and his men have oft assayld Such rich men in their houses. ',
    'So that, through dread of Robbin then And his adventurous crew ,   The '
    'mizers kept great store of men, Which else maintaynd but few. ',
    'King Richard, of that name the first, Sirnamed Cuer de Lyon, Went to '
    'defeate the Pagans curst, Who kept the coasts of Syon. ',
    'The bishop of Ely, chancelor, Was left as vice-roy here, Who like a '
    'potent emperor, Did proudly  domminere. ',
    'Our chronicles of him report That commonly he rode With a thousand horse '
    'from court to court, Where he would make abode. ',
    'He, riding downe towards the north, With his aforesayd traine, Robbin and '
    'his did issue forth, Them all to entertaine. ',
    'And, with the gallant gray-goose wing, They shewed to them such play, '
    'That made their horses kicke and fling, And downe their riders lay. ',
    'Full glad and faine the bishop was, For all his thousand men, To seeke '
    'what meanes he could to passe From out of Robbins ken. ',
    "Two hundred of his men were kil'd, And fourscore horses good; Thirty, who "
    'did as captives yeeld, Were carryed to the greene wood. ',
    'Which afterwards were ransomed, For twenty markes a man; The rest set '
    "spurres to horse, and fled To th' town of Warrington. ",
    'The bishop, sore enraged then, Did, in King Richards name, Muster a power '
    'of northerne men, These outlawes bold to tame. ',
    'But Robbin, with his courtesie, So wonne the meaner sort, That they were '
    'loath on him to try What rigor did import. ',
    'So that bold Robbin and his traine Did live unhurt of them, Vntill King '
    'Richard came againe From  faire Jerusalem. ',
    'And then the talke of Robbin Hood His royall eares did fill;   His Grace '
    "admir'd that ith' greene wood He thus continued still. ",
    'So that the country farre and neare Did give him great applause; For none '
    'of them neede stand in feare, But such as broke the lawes. ',
    'He wished well unto the king, And prayed still for his health, And never '
    'practised any thing Against the common wealth. ',
    "Onely, because he was undone By th' crewell clergie then, All meanes that "
    'he could thinke upon To vexe such kinde of men ',
    'He enterprized, with hatefull spleene; In which he was to blame, For '
    'fault of some, to wreeke his teene On all that by him came. ',
    'With wealth which he by robbery got Eight almes-houses he built, Thinking '
    'thereby to purge the blot Of blood which he had spilt. ',
    'Such was their blinde devotion then, Depending on their workes; Which, it '
    "'twere true, we Christian men Inferiour were to Turkes. ",
    'But, to speak true of Robbin Hood, And wrong him not a iot, He never '
    'would shed any mans blood That him invaded not. ',
    'Nor would he iniure husbandmen, That toyld at cart and plough; For well '
    "he knew, were 't not for them, To live no man knew how. ",
    'The king in person, with some lords, To Notingham did ride, To try what '
    'strength and skill affords To crush these outlawes pride. ',
    'And, as he once before had done, He did againe proclaime, That whosoere '
    'would take upon To bring to Notingham, ',
    'Or any place within the land, Rebellious Robbin Hood, Should be preferd '
    'in place to stand With those of noble blood. ',
    'When Robbin Hood heard of the same, Within a little space,   Into the '
    'towne of Notingham A letter to his Grace ',
    'He shot upon an arrow-head, One evening cunningly; Which was brought to '
    'the king, and read Before his Maiestie. ',
    'The tennour of this letter was, That Robbin would submit, And be true '
    "leigeman to his Grace, In any thing that's fit, ",
    'So that his Highnesse would forgive Him and his merry men all; If not, he '
    "must i th' greene wood live, And take what chance did fall. ",
    'The king would faine have pardoned him, But that some lords say, This '
    'president will much condemne Your Grace another day. ',
    'While that the king and lords did stay Debating on this thing, Some of '
    'these outlawes fled away Unto the Scottish king. ',
    "For they supposed, if he were tane, Or to the king did yeeld, By th' "
    "commons all the rest on 's traine Full quickely would be quelld. ",
    'Of more than full a hundred men But forty tarryed still, Who were resolvd '
    'to sticke to him, Let fortune worke her will. ',
    'If none had fled, all for his sake Had got their pardon free; The king to '
    'favour meant to take His merry men and he. ',
    "But ere the pardon to him came, This famous archer dy'd: His death, and "
    "manner of the same, I'le presently describe. ",
    'For, being vext to thinke upon His followers revolt, In melancholly '
    'passion He did recount their fault. ',
    "`Perfideous traytors!' sayd he then, `In all your dangers past Have I you "
    "guarded as my men To leave me thus at last?' ",
    'This sad perplexity did cause A fever, as some say,   Which him unto '
    'confusion drawes, Though by a stranger way. ',
    'This deadly danger to prevent, He hide him with all speede Vnto a '
    'nunnery, with intent For his healths sake to bleede. ',
    'A faithlesse fryer did pretend In love to let him blood; But he by '
    'falshood wrought the end Of famous Robbin Hood . ',
    'The fryer, as some say, did this To vindicate the wrong Which to the '
    'clergie he and his Had done by power strong. ',
    'Thus dyed he by trechery, That could not dye by force; Had he livd '
    'longer, certainely, King Richard, in remorse, ',
    "Had unto favour him receavd; He brave men elevated; 'Tis pitty he was of "
    'life bereavd By one which he so hated. ',
    'A treacherous leech this fryer was, To let him bleed to death; And Robbin '
    'was, me thinkes, an asse, To trust him with his breath. ',
    "His corpes the priores of the place, The next day that he dy'd, Caused to "
    'be buried, in mean case, Close by the high-way side. ',
    'And over him she caused a stone To be fixed on the ground; An epitaph was '
    'set thereon, Wherein his name was found. ',
    "The date o  th' yeare, and day also, Shee made to be set there, That all "
    'who by the way did goe Might see it plaine appeare ',
    'That such a man as Robbin Hood Was buried in that place; And how he lived '
    'in the greene wood, And robd there for a space. ',
    'It seems that although the clergie he Had put to mickle woe, He should '
    'not quite forgotten be, Although he was their foe. ',
    'This woman, though she did him hate, Yet loved his memory;   And thought '
    'it wondrous pitty that His fame should with him dye. ',
    'This epitaph, as records tell, Within this hundred yeares By many was '
    'discerned well, But time all things outweares. ',

[   'WHEN Flora, with her fragrant flowers, Bedeckt the earth so trim and gay, '
    'And Neptune, with his dainty showers, Came to present the month of May, ',
    'King Henry would a progress ride; Over the river of Thames past he, Unto '
    'a mountain-top also Did walk, some pleasure for to see. ',
    "Where forty merchants he espy'd, With fifty sail, come towards him, Who "
    "then no sooner were arriv'd, But on their knees did thus complain. ",
    "`An 't please Your Grace, we cannot sail To France no voyage, to be sure, "
    "But Sir Andrew Barton makes us quail, And robs us of our merchant-ware.' ",
    'Vext was the king, and turned him, Said to the lords of high degree, Have '
    'I ner a lord within my realm Dare fetch that traytor unto me? ',
    "To him repli'd Lord Charles Howard: I will, my liege, with heart and "
    'hand;   If it please you grant me leave, he said, I will perform what you '
    'command. ',
    'To him then spake King Henry: I fear, my lord, you are too young. `No '
    "whit at all, my liege,' quoth he; `I hope to prove in valour strong. ",
    '`The Scottish knight I vow to seek, In what place soever he be, And bring '
    "a shore, with all his might, Or into Scotland he shall carry me.' ",

    'Besides sailors and ship-boys To guide a great ship on the sea. ',
    '`Bow-men and gunners of good skill Shall for this service chosen be, And '
    "they at thy command and will In all affairs shall wait on thee.' ",
    'Lord Howard calld a gunner then Who was the best in all the realm; His '
    'age was threescore years and ten, And Peter Simon was his name. ',
    'My lord calld then a bow-man rare, Whose active hands had gained fame, A '
    'gentleman born in Yorkshire, And William Horsly was his name. ',
    "`Horsly,' quoth he, `I must to sea, To seek a traytor, with great speed; "
    "Of a hundred bow-men brave,' quoth he, `I have chosen thee to be the "

    '`If you, my lord, have chosen me Of a hundred men to be the head, Upon '
    "the main-mast I'le hanged be, If twelve-score I miss one shillings "
    "breadth.' ",
    'Lord Howard then, of courage bold, Went to the sea with pleasant chear, '
    'Not curbd with winters piercing cold, Though it was the stormy time of '
    'the year. ',
    'Not long he had been on the sea, No more in days then number three, Till '
    'one Henry Hunt he there espied, A merchant of Newcastle was he. ',
    'To him Lord Howard cald out amain, And strictly charged him to stand; '
    'Demanding then from whence he came, Or where he did intend to land. ',
    'The merchant then made him answer soon, With heavy heart and careful '
    "mind,   `My lord, my ship it doth belong Unto Newcastle upon Tine.' ",
    "`Canst thou shew me,' the lord did say, `As thou didst sail by day and "
    "night, A Scottish rover on the  sea, His name is Andrew Barton, knight?' ",
    'Then to him the merchant sighd and said, With grieved mind and well a '
    'way, `But over well I know that wight, I was his prisoner but yesterday. ',
    '`As I, my lord, did pass from France, A Burdeaux voyage to take so far, I '
    'met with Sir Andrew Barton thence, Who robd me of my merchant-ware. ',
    '`And mickle debts, God knows, I owe, And every man did crave his own; And '
    "I am bound to London now, Of our gracious king to beg a boon.' ",
    "`Shew me him,' said Lord Howard then, `Let me but once the villain see, "
    "And one penny he hath from the tane, I'le double the same with shillings "
    "three.' ",
    "`Now, God forbid,' the merchant said; `I fear your aim that you will "
    'miss; God bless you from his tyranny, For little you know what man he '
    'is. ',
    '`He is brass within and steel without, His ship most huge and mighty '

    'along. ',
    '`With beams for his top-castle, As also being huge and high, That neither '
    "English nor Portugal Can pass Sir Andrew Barton by.' ",
    "`Hard news thou shewst,' then said the lord, `To welcome strangers to the "
    "sea; But, as I said, I'le bring him aboard, Or into Scotland he shall "
    "carry me.' ",
    'The merchant said, If you will do so, Take counsel, then, I pray withal: '
    'Let no man to his top-castle go, Nor strive to let his beam<s down fall. ',
    "`Lend me seven pieces of ordnance then, Of each side of my ship,' quoth "
    'he, `And to-morrow, my lord, twixt six and seven, Again I will Your '
    'Honour see. ',
    "`A glass I'le set that may be seen Whether you sail by day or night;   "
    'And to-morrow, be sure, before seven, You shall see Sir Andrew Barton, '
    "knight.' ",
    'The merchant set my lord a glass, So well apparent in his sight That on '
    'the morrow, as his promise was, He saw Sir Andrew Barton, knight. ',
    'The lord then swore a mighty oath, `Now by the heavens that be of might, '
    'By faith, believe me, and by troth, I think he is a worthy knight. ',
    "`Fetch me my lyon out of hand,' Saith the lord, 'with rose and streamer "
    "high; Set up withal a willow-wand, That merchant-like I may pass by.' ",
    'Thus bravely did Lord Howard pass, And did on anchor rise so high; No '
    'top-sail at all he cast, But as his foe he did him defie. ',
    'Sir Andrew Barton seeing him Thus scornfully to pass by, As though he '
    'cared not a pin For him and all his company, ',
    "Then called he his men amain, `Fetch back yon pedler now,' quoth he, `And "
    "against this way he comes again I'le teach him well his courtesie.' ",
    'A piece of ordnance soon was shot By this proud pirate fiercely then Into '
    'Lord Howards middle deck, Which cruel shot killd fourteen men. ',
    'He calld then Peter Simon, he; `Look now thy word do stand in stead, For '
    'thou shalt be hanged on main-mast If thou miss twelve score one penny '
    "breadth.' ",
    'Then Peter Simon gave a shot Which did Sir Andrew mickle scare, In at his '
    'deck it came so hot, Killd fifteen of his men of war. ',
    "`Alas!' then said the pyrate stout, `I am in danger now, I see; This is "
    "some lord, I greatly doubt, That is set on to conquer me.' ",
    'Then Henry Hunt, with rigor hot, Came bravely on the other side, Who '
    'likewise shot in at his deck, And kild fifty of his men beside. ',
    "Then `Out, alas!' Sir Andrew cri'd, `What may a man now think or say!   "
    "Yon merchant thief that pierceth me, He was my prisoner yesterday.' ",
    'Then did he on Gordion call, Unto top-castle for to go, And bid his beams '
    "he should let fall, `For I greatly fear an overthrow.' ",
    'The lord cald Horsly now in hast: `Look that thy word stand now in stead, '
    'For thou shalt be hanged on main-mast If thou miss twelve score one '
    "Shillings breadth.' ",
    'Then up the mast-tree swarved he, This stout and mighty Gordion; But '
    'Horsly, he most happily Shot him under the collar-bone. ',
    'Then calld he on his nephew then, Said, Sisters sons I have no mo; Three '
    'hundred pound I will give thee, If thou wilt to top-castle go. ',
    'Then stoutly he began to climb, From off the mast scornd to depart; But '
    'Horsly soon prevented him, And deadly piercd him to the heart. ',
    'His men being slain, then up amain Did this proud pyrate climb with '
    'speed, For armour of proof he had put on, And did not dint of arrow '
    'dread. ',
    "`Come hither, Horsly,' said the lord, `See thine arrow aim aright; Great "
    "means to thee I will afford, And if you speed, I'le make you a knight.' ",
    'Sir Andrew did climb up the tree, With right good will and all his main; '
    'Then upon the breast hit Horsly he, Till the arrow return again. ',
    'Then Horsly spied a private place, With a perfect eye, in a secret part; '
    'His arrow swiftly flew apace, And smote Sir Andrew to the heart. ',
    '`Fight on, fight on, my merry men all, A little I am hurt, yet not slain; '
    "I'le but lie down and bleed a while, And come and fight with you again. ",
    "`And do not,' he said, 'Fear English rogues, And of your foes stand not "
    'in awe, But stand fast by St Andrews cross, Until you hear my whistle '
    "blow.' ",
    'They never heard his whistle blow, Which made them all sore afraid:   '
    "Then Horsly said, My lord, aboard, For now Sir Andrew Barton's dead. ",
    'Thus boarded they this gallant ship, With right good will and all their '
    'main, Eighteen score Scots alive in it, Besides as many more were slain. ',
    'The lord went where Sir Andrew lay, And quickly thence cut off his head: '
    '`I should forsake England many a day, If thou wert alive as thou art '
    "dead.' ",
    'Thus from the wars Lord Howard came, With mickle joy and triumphing; The '
    'pyrates head he brought along For to present unto our king: ',
    'Who briefly then to him did say, Before he knew well what was done, '
    "`Where is the knight and pyrate gay? That I my self may give the doom.' ",
    "`You may thank God,' then said the lord, `And four men in the ship,' "
    'quoth he, `That we are safely come ashore, Sith you had never such an '
    'enemy: ',
    '`That is Henry Hunt, and Peter Simon, William Horsly, and Peters son; '
    'Therefore reward them for their pains, For they did service at their '

    'tane, I give to the a noble a day, Sir Andrews whistle and his chain: ',
    '`To Peter Simon a crown a day, And half-a-crown a day to Peters son, And '
    'that was for a shot so gay, Which bravely brought Sir Andrew down. ',
    '`Horsly, I will make thee a knight, And in Yorkshire thou shalt dwell: '
    'Lord Howard shall Earl Bury hight, For this title he deserveth well. ',
    '`Seven shillings to our English men, Who in this fight did stoutly stand, '

[   'OLD Grahame he is to Carlisle gone, Where Sir Robiertr Bewick there met '

    'merry. ',
    "Old Grahame he took up the cup, And said, `Brother Bewick, here's to "
    "thee; And here's to our two sons at home, For they live best in our "
    "country.' ",
    '`Nay, were thy son as good as mine, And of some books he could but read, '
    'With sword and buckler by his side, To see how he could save his head, ',
    '`They might have been calld two bold brethren Where ever they did go or '
    'ride; They might have been calld two bold brethren, They might have '
    'crackd the Border-side. ',
    '`Thy son is bad, and is but a lad, And bully to my son cannot be; For my '
    "son Bewick can both write and read, Amd sure I am that cannot he.' ",
    '`I put him to school, but he would not learn, I bought him books, but he '
    "would not read;   But my blessing he's never have Till I see how his hand "
    "can save his head.' ",
    'Old Grahame called for an account, And he askd what was for to pay; There '
    'he paid a crown, so it went round, Which was all for good wine and hay. ',
    'Old Grahame is into the stable gone, Where stood thirty good steeds and '
    "three; He's taken his own steed by the head, And home rode he right "
    'wantonly. ',

    '`Nay, I have been in Carlisle town, Where Sir Robert Bewick there met me; '

    '`Nay, for to kill my bully dear, I think it will be a deadly sin; And for '
    'to kill my father dear, The blessing of heaven I neer shall win. ',
    "`O give me your blessing, father,' he said, `And pray well for me to "
    "thrive; If it be my fortune my bully to kill, I swear I'll neer come home "
    "alive.' ",
    'He put on his back a good plate-jack, And on his head a cap of steel, '
    'With sword and buckler by his side; O gin he did not become them well! ',
    '`O fare thee well, my father dear! And fare thee well, thou Carlisle '

    "Now we'll leave talking of Christy Grahame, And talk of him again belive; "

    'five. ',
    'Now when he had learnd them well to fence, To handle their swords without '
    "any doubt, He's taken his own sword under his arm, And walkd his father's "
    'close about. ',
    'He lookd between him and the sun, To see what farleys he could see; There '
    "he spy'd a man with armour on, As he came riding over the lee. ",
    '`I wonder much what man yon be That so boldly this way does come; I think '
    'it is my nighest friend, I think it is my bully Grahame. ',
    '`O welcome, O welcome, bully Grahame! O man, thou art my dear, welcome! O '
    "man, thou art my dear, welcome! For I love thee best in Christendom.' ",
    '`Away, away, O bully Bewick, And of thy bullyship let me be! The day is '
    "come I never thought on; Bully, I'm come here to fight with thee.' ",
    '`O no! not so, O bully Grahame! That eer such a word should spoken be!   '
    "I was thy master, thou was my scholar: So well as I have learne:d thee.' ",
    'My father he was in Carlisle town, Where thy father Bewick there met he; '
    'He said I was bad, and he calld me a lad, And a baffled man by thou I '
    "be.' ",
    "`Away, away, O bully Grahame. And of all that talk, man, let us be! We'll "
    "take three men of either side To see if we can our fathers agree.' ",
    '`Away, away, O bully Bewick, And of thy bullyship let me be! But if thou '
    "be a man, as I trow thou art, Come over this ditch and fight with me.' ",
    '`O no! not so, my bully Grahame! That eer such a word should spoken be! '
    "Shall I venture my body in field to fight With a man that's faith and "
    "troth to me?' ",
    '`Away, away, O bully Bewick, And of all that care, man, let us be! If '
    'thou be a man, as I trow thou art, Come over this ditch and fight with '
    "me.' ",
    "`Now, if it be my fortune thee, Grahame, to kill, As God's will's, man, "
    "it all must be; But if it be my fortune thee, Grahame, to kill, 'Tis home "
    "again I'll never gae.' ",
    '`Thou art of my mind then, bully Bewick, And sworn-brethren will we be; '
    'If thou be a man, as I trow thou art, Come over this ditch and fight with '
    "me.' ",
    'He flang his cloak from off his shoulders, His psalm-book out of his hand '
    'flang he, He clapd his hand upon the hedge, And oer lap he right '
    'wantonly. ',
    'When Grahame did see his bully come, The salt tear stood long in his eye: '
    '`Now needs must I say that thou art a man, That dare venture thy body to '
    'fight with me. ',
    '`Now I have a harness on my back; I know that thou hath none on thine; '
    'But as little as thou hath on thy back, Sure as little shall there be on '
    "mine.' ",
    'He flang his jack from off his back, His steel cap from his head flang '
    "he; He's taken his sword into his hand, He's tyed his horse unto a tree. ",
    'Now they fell to it with two broa<d swords, For two long hours fought '
    'Bewick and he;   Much sweat was to be seen on them both, But never a drop '
    'of blood to see. ',
    '`Now Grahame gave Bewick an ackward stroke, An ackward stroke surely '
    'struck he; He struck him now under the left breast, Then down to the '
    'ground as dead fell he. ',
    '`Arise, arise, O bully Bewick, Arise, and speak three words to me! '
    'Whether this be thy deadly wound, Or God and good surgeons will mend '
    "thee.' ",
    '`O horse, O horse, O bully Grahame, And pray do get thee far from me! Thy '
    'sword is sharp, it hath wounded my heart, And so no further can I gae. ',
    '`O horse, O horse, O bully Grahame, And get thee far from me with speed! '
    "And get thee out of this country quite! That none may know who's done the "
    "deed.' ",
    '`O if this be true, my bully dear, The words that thou dost tell to me, '
    "The vow I made, and the vow I'll keep; I swear I'll be the first that "
    'die. ',
    'Then he stuck his sword in a moody-hill, Where he lap thirty good foot '
    'and three; First he bequeathed his soul to God, And upon his own '
    'sword-point lap he. ',
    'Now Grahame he was the first that died, And then came Robin Bewick to '
    "see; `Arise, arise, O son!' he said, `For I see thou's won the victory. ",
    "`Arise, arise, O son!' he said, `For I see thou's won the victory:' "
    '`Father, co>uld ye not drunk your wine at home, And le>tten me and my '
    'brother be? ',
    '`Nay, dig a grave both low and wide, And in it us two pray bury; But bury '
    "my bully Grahame on the sun-side, For I'm sure he's won the victory.' ",
    "Now we'll leave talking of these two brethren, In Carlisle town where "
    'they lie slain, And talk of these two good old men, Where they were '
    'making a pitiful moan. ',
    'With that bespoke now Robin Bewick: `O man, was I not much to blame? I '
    "have lost one of the liveliest lads That ever was bred unto my name.' ",
    'With that bespoke my good lord Grahame: `O man, I have lost the better '
    'block;   I have lost my comfort and my joy, I have lost my key, I have '
    'lost my lock. ',
    '`Had I gone through all Ladderdale, And forty horse had set on me, Had '
    "Christy Grahame been at my back, So well as he woud guarded me.' ",
    "I have no more of my song to sing, But two or three words to you I'll "
    "name; But 'twill be talk'd in Carlisle town That these two old men were "
    'all the blame.']
